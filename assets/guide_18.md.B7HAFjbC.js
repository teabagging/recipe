I also used heavy whipping cream, because it was on hand and I have no idea what 18% table cream is. Ha,ha! I only used 3 cans of the condensed soup, and there was plenty of gravy even with doubling the batch. Also, I transferred my nicely browned patties to a baking dish, poured half of the gravy on top, then flipped them and covered them with the remaining gravy, and tightly sealed the dish with aluminum foil, and then baked it in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 55 minutes.

I also use a low-sodium beef stock and flour mixture often and add the can of mushrooms including the juice. Not only so simple, easy and flavourful, it tastes divine.

I'm an old-fashioned polentum, and the idea of creamy polenta sets my teeth on edge. This recipe is very well written. Just a couple of thoughts -- I use less water, about 3 1/4 cups per cup of polenta, and less salt, about 1/2 tablespoon per cup of polenta. The trickiest part of cooking polenta is avoiding the formation of lumps: stay away from instant polenta, heat the water so that the surface is barely shivering when you pour it in, and stir rapidly when pouring it in. Once you try it, you'll understand what pull away from the sides of the pot means. That is an accurate description. I usually halve the recipe for the 2 of us, and the polenta cooks up in about 20 minutes. I use a stainless steel pot (my Grandma used a huge copper kettle on a wood-burning stove); after cooking and pouring out, the film in the pot will come off easily once soaked in cold water. For a nice presentation lightly oil a loaf pan and pour the polenta into it immediately after cooking and cover with foil. It will stay warm for a long time, firm up, and then can be unmolded on a serving platter.

I have been making this awesome recipe since the early 1980s (it is the only mayo my family and friends will eat). But my process is slightly different. I always double the ingredients. I put the eggs, hot English dry mustard, salt and vinegar in a food processor and buzz them for 30 seconds. With the processor motor still running, I then slowly add the oil in a fine stream. If you add the oil too fast the whole mixture will curdle. By the way, you can make it with canola, sunflower, vegetable or olive oil...but never use peanut oil. I learned that the hard way...and it tastes terrible. Also, don't worry too much about the raw egg. I have served this recipe to many ages...from 2 to 96...with no ill effects. But I am very careful about my source of eggs. And a last comment, I think a great aspect of this mayo is the lack of sugar.

I used a storebought shortbread crust that I put an eggwash on and baked per package instructions. I used Bird's Custard Powder, but having never tried it before, I'm not sure I made it correctly. I followed the instructions given in this recipe, but they didn't match up with the instructions on the canister. After I removed the custard mixture from the heat, I had to toss it in the blender to get rid of the lumps that I couldn't get to dissolve. Then I returned it to the pan over the heat, and continuously whisked it, and then it finally became homogenous and more thick. I may have needed to cook it even longer, because the chilled custard on the pie was still somewhat loose, but I think that's my own fault for taking it off the heat too soon. No matter, it still tasted very good. At first I thought that the custard wasn't going to be sweet enough, but I'm glad I didn't add extra sugar, because the other elements of the pie were plenty sweet. Very good, thanks for posting!

It was my choice that I carry on the Family tradition of having Clam Chowder (and cheese bread) for Christmas Eve dinner this year. You see... the Matriarch of our family passed away this year at the age of 96 years old. She has prepared Clam Chowder every year at Christmas for a long,long time. So with the Holiday's fast approaching I set out to find the perfect recipe for chowder and found it with this one.It was very thick & creamy and unbelievably easy to prepare. It took all of one hour for me to put together. I did not veer from the recipe provided and used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of russets. Of three pots of soup there this one was devoured quite fast !

Celery soup - I used 1 x 295g Campbells Celery Soup, diluted as directed on the can.  Chop the potatoes small - about half the size of a sugar cube.  You may need to add more liquid at stage 5, I put in some of the prepared celery soup to add to the clam juice from the can.  Dill Weed is called tarragon in the UK (also by the way heavy cream means double cream in the UK) - I used dried tarragan which tasted fine, I also put in a teaspoon of dried thyme as I have seen this in most other NECC recipes.

I bought fresh minced clams (in their juice) and used half and half. After I browned 4 slices of Oscar Mayer bacon and a whole vidalia onion (chopped); I added two cans of cream of celery soup, two cans of half and half and all of the clam juice to make a broth. Separately, I boiled potatoes, and acknowledging the other reviews, I only peeled and cut up two potatoes so as not to make it too potato-ey. I reserved the fresh minced clams until the end so that they would not get overcooked and rubbery (thanks for that tip too!). The stock seemed a little thin, so I added two tablespoons of Idahoan instant buttery potato, sprinkling it in the broth and letting it dissolve. It thickened the broth and the taste was wonderful--flavor from the soup stock, half and half and clam juice--plus richness from the instant potatoes. I added half a stick of butter to the bacon when it was cooked before I put the onions in too. Now, the chowder is just simmering under a boil--stirring so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the Le Creuset pot--adding the clams last and letting them heat through for flavor but not overcooking them is the last step. Coarse pepper ground on top. I bought two pumpernickel bagels at the farmer's market and will toast them and spread cream cheese on top to go with this hearty chowder for our supper by the New England coast.

My only exposure to clam chowder was while visting in Maine and New Hampshire during the winter one year. The chowder I enjoyed the most was thick, creamy and had a fair amount of potatoes. So that is why I started with this recipe. I read other reviews and incorporated some of their suggestions.<br/><br/>I doubled the amount of canned clams. I was concerned that the extra amount of clam juice would make the soup to thin, but that was not the case. It really brought out a nice clam flavor.<br/><br/>I added two stalks of chopped celery to add little more texture variation.

I will say I always amend recipes just a tad and this was no different. I used 3 strips of bacon, half a large onion and 4 cans of chopped clams. Additionally I only had 4 potatoes. So I rendered the bacon, threw in the onions (with 2 T butter), once they were translucent I drained all 4 cans of clams and added the clam juice to the potatoes. I also added one cup of water since it just didn't seem like enough liquid. Simmered that for 10 minutes until the potatoes were tender and then added the celery soup, clams, 1 cup half-n-half and pepper. I only just heated it through and served it and my little family declared it a success! My daughter loves it and was overjoyed that I learned a new recipe and made it for her!

I used most of the juice to have enough liquid to cook the potatoes, about half, and then added the rest when I added the heavy cream and milk. The only seasonings I added was a pinch of salt and pepper. There&#039;s no need to make and add a roux or a flour and water slurry to thicken it. The cream of celery soup does a fine job.

I have made a few changes for our use and continue to vary the ingredients depending on what my whim is at the time. I add fresh minced garlic to the bacon when I add the onions, typically 0.5 to 0.75 teaspoons depending on the garlic (twice that for double pot). I use canned clams and juice, but stick to fresh for veggies or additional seafood. I often add some shrimp or cod to cook in the chowder during the last stage. In addition to the dill weed, I add 1.0 to 1.5 teaspoons of Bay seasoning. I have used a variety of &quot;cream of&quot; soups and often mix them - the current family favorite is a can of mushroom and a can of potato, but celery combined with cream of broccoli is also good. This last batch also got a fresh ear of corn (microwave in husk 3 minutes, cut off cob) and that looks like a permanent addition. I typically use whole milk and occasionally use all heavy cream, but that is too rich for some folks. Celery, carrots, other compatible veggies may make it into a batch just depending on what is in the kitchen. I try to never full boil the chowder - soft small bubbles and lower heat (yeah, I'm lame and I probably stir too often) for 60-90 minutes makes a perfect consistency. My guys like the Pillsbury Cresent Rounds with the chowder, but any warm, fresh bread works. I assume the chowder would keep for 4-5 days properly strored, but we'll never know since any size batch disappears in less than 48 hours. Love it. p.s. I use the same process (bacon, onions, garlic, then potatoes and chicken stock or broth) to make a base for a fantastic creamy chicken chowder with fresh vegetables and rice. You can figure out how yourself, but cream of chicken is obvious and we prefer grilled chicken (couple lbs breast and/or dark, cut into small cubes). This recipe can be pushed toward barbeque, teriyaki, or other chicken flavor and can be spiced up or down for heat.

I used the same 1/4 cup portions of batter)!\\n\\nI didn&#039;t have fresh lemon juice for the icing, so I used bottled (this was a bad choice--next time I will use fresh). The flavor of the white icing was a bit lacking. I think adding some extra vanilla or other liqueur could have made up for the bottled lemon juice. The chocolate icing was very good, as the cocoa powder covered up the bottled lemon juice flavor.\\n\\nThe white icing was runny compared to the chocolate. Start with less liquid than you think you need for the white icing.\\n\\nMake sure to allow the icing to dry before eating!"},{"name":"fresh figs and yogurt","steps":"submerge figs in hot water for 1 minute', 'drain , peel , and quarter each fig', 'beat the cream lightly , and blend it into the yogurt', 'spoon a little of the cream mixture into four sherbet glasses', 'top with a layer of figs and continue with alternating layers , finishing with a layer of cream', 'sprinkle each layer with the sugar', it's up to you, 'i have tossed the figs in the sugar before with decent results', 'chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours to allow the sugar to melt into the cream'","description":"this is from a cookbook entitled creative cooking, and somehow manages to be both refreshing and decadent. it's so good. if you can only get small figs, use a few more; the glasses should be full almost to the top. why not just make a double batch anyway? i usually do. :) i hope you enjoy this! please note: cooking time is chilling time.","ingredients":"fresh figs', 'heavy cream', 'yogurt', 'light brown sugar'","review":"The cookies are a little bit dry, but the flavor and texture of the overall cookie is wonderful--it's a soft, more cake-like confection that's a vehicle for the icing. I increased the amount of buttermilk by an additional 1/3 cup, and used a 3 TB disher to portion out the cookies. I also with wet hands slightly pressed the cookie dough balls down so the domed shape wouldn't be so dramatic. With the icing I really do like the lemon aspect in the vanilla, but not so much for the chocolate. Like another review suggests you can substitute the lemon juice for water for a cleaner vanilla and chocolate icing flavor.

I substituted pepper jack for some of the cheddar because it is what I had on hand.  The dish was still great.

(And I'm not exactly the best pastry chef!) I used it with Dorel's Apple Pie Filling (recipe ID#75659) and it was scrumptious! The pie plate I used was the deep dish type, and I had to roll out the dough a bit more to make it accomodate the pie dish, but even though it was thinly rolled, it was still flaky and tender when baked! (I am very impressed!) After the pie was baked, I sprinkled the crust lightly with sugar. Next time, I'll either make the dough portions larger if using the deep pie dish, or I'll use a regular sized pie pan. I still have some dough in the fridge, and I'm planning on making a chicken pie tomorrow! (Yum!) This pie crust was a great success, and I'll be using it regularly from now on! Thanks a bunch for posting this! UPDATE:  I used the leftover dough to make a chicken pie last night, and it was fabulous!  I used the same deep dish pie plate, but this time, instead of using two of the dough portions, I used all remaining three.

I made this in the food processor using the new Crisco trans fat free shortening, which I think is a little softer at room temperature than regular shortening and makes for a slightly stickier dough. I've always found it easier to roll pie crust between layers of wax paper or parchment which I did. I was pretty sloppy rolling it out, made a very thin crust and ended up patching one part. Even with all of this bad pastry chef behavior, the crust held together perfectly after baking. I had no shrinkage, and even the patched place came out very nicely. Used with Roosie's Nutella Pumpkin Pie #73940 in which the crust is prebaked with weights. It came out beautifully and the best part is, I have 4 more crusts in the freezer for future pies. Thanks, Edith! UPDATE: I used two of my frozen pie crusts for Chocolate Cream Pie #43100, in which a baked pie shell is used, and my pecan pie for Thanksgiving. Both were fantastic! I rolled the thawed dough between wax paper coated with a little flour (I forgot the flour last time) and once again, it was easy and very forgiving to work with and absolutely delicious.

Next time I am in New Zealand where the sweetcorn instustry and supermarkets understand that keeping ALL the husk on the cob, keeps the flavour better, I will make and enjoy this again (and again) becuase I'm sure it will turn out even better than my Dutch attempts.
