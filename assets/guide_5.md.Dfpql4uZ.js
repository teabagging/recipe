They were excellent, but I didn't roast them long enough as they weren't crispy on the outside, like everyone else said. Since the turkey was out of the oven and I had to heat everything (mashed potatoes, turnip puff, nifty carrots) up at the same time in the oven, they probably would have taken longer than 40 minutes. Everythign but the sprouts were ready, so I took them out. Even though they weren't brown and crispy on the outside, they were definitely very tasty! I also used frozen sprouts that I thawed beforehand and they worked out perfectly! I'll definitely make them again when I don't have such a HUGE meal to prepare and I have the time to cook them for the prescribed period of time. I even threw some of the leftovers into Rescued Turkey Stock (#24576) and they worked really well. I wouldn't recco making them on such a huge meal as thxgiving or Christmas unless you are lucky enough to have a convection or two ovens. The time frame with heating everything else up just didn't jive, which was my fault. They still turned out great!\\nEdited to add:  I made these the other night to serve with Ribeye steak.  This time, I halved the olive oil and added a few splashes of Sesame oil and then tossed the sprouts in that.  They were absolutely fantastic.

Thank you, Sharon123 for posting such a wonderful way to prepare brussels sprouts.  I follow it pretty much to the letter.  I'd recommend to watch your sprouts closely (until you learn how your oven handles these delectable veggies), as they can burn very easily.  Can you guess how I know that?  :-)  Last winter, I even prepared this with frozen sprouts (just didn't want to wait for the fresh ones!)  It was tasty, but not near as good as fresh.  So, if you can't find fresh, that is an option.  However, fresh sprouts are definitely best!  This dish is one of our (4 kids, hubby & me!) absolute favorite sides!

It worked okay, but next time I'll use the big one because it turned out a little difficult to saute so much veggies at once without flipping them out of the pan. I somehow missed the end of step 3 where I was supposed to transfer the veggies to a baking dish (think I got side-tracked by the other dish I was making), but maybe that could be it's own sentence so it stands out a bit more in the directions. So I ended up pouring the egg/cheese mixture over the veggies while they were still in the frying pan, got to the next step and realized that the veggies should have already gone into the baking dish and that cheeses in step 4 must have been a typo (I added both kinds of cheese in that step because it used the plural), so I ended up with everything just kind of mixed together in the casserole dish with just the parsley on top. I used fresh Italian parsley, 1 1/2 tsp seasoning salt, and 3/4 tsp pepper. DH (who really hates cabbage) thought it was very tasty/really good, once you got beyond the smell. Lil' sis thought it was pretty descent which seems to be pretty high praise coming from her; she did say that she usually doesn't like cabbage much, but didn't really indicate that this recipe had changed her mind much. I thought it was pretty good too, but I'm the one who likes cabbage.

Worthy of 5 stars, but anyone trying this recipe should keep an eye on the bread as it cooks, or it could easily burn.  My Zoji doesn't have a sweet bread setting, so I used the Basic setting and ended up removing the bread 15 minutes before the end of the baking cycle.  It would have been burnt if I hadn't, I think!  Even still, the crust was a bit overcooked.  No fault of the recipe, though, as the bread itself is delicious.  I'll definitely make this one again, but next time I'll just let the bread machine mix the dough and I'll bake the bread in the oven.  I might also mention that I also add in the fruit before the machine beeps for it.  I wait just long enough for the dough ball to come together, and then I add in the extras.  I've found from experience that if I wait for the beep, the add-ins never seem to get evenly mixed into the dough as well as I'd like.  I may try adding some chopped or slivered almonds with the fruit next time, too!"},{"name":"dorito sandwich  for kids","steps":"spread butter on hard roll', 'pile on doritos', 'cut in half and eat it'","description":"sounds gross, and probably is. a friend of mine (yes, an adult)has been eating this since she was little and apparently still eats it. i was so intrigued by the odd-ballness of this sandwich that i thought i should post it.","ingredients":"hard roll', 'butter', 'plain doritos'","review":"Excellent !!!  \\n\\nThe second time I made it I added 4 Tbps of sugar instead of te recommended 2 Tbps to make it a touch sweeter.

Turned out well the first time I made it but I had to increase the flour to 4 cups the first time around.  I have now, however, tweaked it a little to suit the climate in Malaysia which is hot and humid. I reduced the water to 2/3 cup and the yeast to 1 1/2 tsp (but maintained the flour at 3 1/4 cups) and increased the sugar to 4 tbsp (as we like the bread a bit sweeter). Instead of 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla essence, I used 1 tsp vanilla essence, 1/4 tsp orange emulco (or orange oil) and 1/4 tsp lemon paste (or lemon flavor) - this gave it the citrus taste as I personally do not like store bought mixed peel in my bread. I also increased the fruit to 1 cup and used dried apricots, raisins and cranberries (my favorites).
