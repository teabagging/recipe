However, I really believe this recipe could be outstanding if you know what NOT to do.  So bear with me.  First let me say what I loved about this recipe:  1.  It incorporates everything I keep on hand (except for the whipping cream, discussed further below), but mixes it up in a completely new way.  2. Anything with chipotles I love.  Add it to a creamy soup broth and I'm in love just talking about it!  3. The pureed vegetables and broth as a thickener is BRILLIANT!  (Is that common practice in chowders?  I don't ever make them, but I thought they relied solely on heavy cream...)  Anyway, unfortunately, my batch didn't turn out so good.  I mostly blame myself, though.  Here are some tips on what NOT to do.  I end with my gameplan for the next time I try this out.  1.  Whenever I open a new can of chipotles, I freeze them on waxed paper with the adobo sauce spread evenly over top each of the chiles.  Because of this, I used WAY more than the 1 T adobo sauce called for.  After the sauteeing stage, I ended up throwing out three of the peppers because otherwise it would have been inedible.  (I chopped the fourth pepper but left the other three whole as a precaution -- SO glad I did!).  It was still REALLY spicy.  2. Even after sauteeing and simmering for more than the alotted amount of time, my celery and carrots never quite softened.  I was running out of time, so I hoped the pureeing process would make up for it; however, because they weren't soft enough, they never did puree, which left me with a strange texture of broth (think broth combined with mush combined with tiny pieces of hard veggies...).  3.  I thought I'd be smart and dump everything into my food processor (instead of 3 batches in the blender).  I don't know if a blender would have made my veggies smoother or not.  (I also made a mess of my processor and counter because there was slightly too much broth, but I didn't realize until after I removed the unit from the base.)  4.  My potatoes didn't cook through in the alotted amount of time, either.  5. Because I had so many issues, I was so over it by the time it was ready to serve, so I didn't bother adding the whipping cream, cilantro, or lime.  Thankfully, though, my boyfriend ate and enjoyed it (strange texture, un-cooked potatoes and all), which encouraged me to have some for lunch today, and the flavor REALLY is good.  So, I've decided I'm not giving up on this recipe yet!  Here's what I'll do next time:  1.  I will start with one chipotle and see how I feel after sauteeing.  Might end up using two, but I doubt I'll go to three.  2. I will sautee the heck out of my veggies until they're good and soft.  Then I will simmer in order to meld everything together for a bit.  3. I will be a good girl and follow the poster's advice:  three separate batches in a blender.  4.  Either plan ahead so I can cook the potatoes longer, or nuke them for a bit before adding them to the soup.  5. DEFINITELY add the remaining ingredients (though I will have to try evap milk...I never have cream)!  I know they will add killer flavor!  I feel bad for punking out last night.  6.  Add more salt..."},{"name":"kiwi  berries and yogurt parfait with toasted coconut","steps":"in a martini glass , spoon a dollop of the yogurt into the base of the glass , then top with a sprinkling of graham crackers , a layer of diced fruit , then a few berries', 'then start again with the yogurt , continuing the pattern until the glass is filled', 'garnish by sprinkling 1 tablespoon of the toasted coconut on top', 'repeat with the remaining 3 glasses and serve immediately'","description":"cat cora's recipe from parade magazine.  sounds lovely!","ingredients":"yogurt', 'graham cracker', 'fruit', 'blackberry', 'shredded coconut'","review":"This was my first time making an eggplant stew.

I think the flour and milk should be added alternately--I felt I was overbeating, as it took quite a bit of mixing to incorporate the milk into the stiff dough after all the flour was added. Although the butter will inhibit gluten development and help keep the cookies tender, I suppose it is just stuck in my head that cookie dough should not be beaten after the flour is mixed in to avoid developing the gluten. I found it difficult to roll the dough into 24-inch ropes and keep it an even thickness, so I divided the dough again so I only had to deal with 12 inches at a time. (You'll probably want to flour your board before trying to work with the dough.) I also had a problem twisting and making loops out of the 3-inch segments (at least the way I interpreted the directions), so I basically ended up with small circles. Unless I was making larger cookies, next time I would skip the labor-intensive roping and shaping and just shape them into slightly-flattened balls. With cookies of this size, the shape seems to get lost anyway by the time they are baked and decorated. I was trying to stay true to the recipe since I hoped to submit a representative photo, but in the future will take you up on your suggestion to shape them however I like (which for me will be the easy way). :) After tasting the baked cookies prior to icing them, even though I added extra lemon zest, the lemon flavor just didn't seem to come through so I used lemon juice rather than orange to thin the icing and just dipped the tops of the cookies in it instead of brushing it on. Next time, I think I would substitute a bit of lemon extract for some of the vanilla in the dough.I hope I don't sound negative, because we did enjoy these cookies--thanks for posting the recipe!"},{"name":"kiwicats gourmet salad with chicken","steps":"preparation:', 'chicken', 'lightly coat pan with olive oil', 'saut chopped garlic cloves and ginger for about a minute then cook chicken thighs until done or lightly browned', 'add 1 / 2 cup of white wine and 1 / 2 cup of water and let it simmer for about 3min', 'squeeze fresh lemon juice on top of chicken thighs', 'let cool', 'then chop the chicken things into small pieces', 'brown rice', 'follow the directions on the package for absorption method', 'let cool', 'blanche green beens in boiling water for 1 minute let cool', 'hard boil the eggs', 'building the salad:', 'place 4 washed lettuce leaves on each plate', 'combine the brown rice with the green beans and mix together', 'place one-two big spoonfuls of rice & beans in the center of the lettuce leaves', 'then add the chicken to each plate , on top of the rice', 'garnish:', 'thinly slice the avocado and hard boiled eggs and place around the lettuce leaves', 'slice in half the cherry tomatoes and do likewise', 'optional:', 'then to top everything off i dabbed a spoonful of chutney on top and poured the sauce that was from the chicken on top of the salad along with some grated parmesan cheese'","description":"i made this salad for my family for part of my online health class. man, was it awesome!!! a great recipe for someone who wants to begin eating healthy without losing good taste. i hope you enjoy it as much as i did!!!","ingredients":"lettuce leaves', 'brown rice', 'chicken thighs', 'cherry tomatoes', 'hard-boiled eggs', 'avocado', 'green beans', 'fresh ginger', 'fresh garlic cloves', 'lemons', 'white wine', 'water'","review":"Easy redipe but I added lemon juice in addition to the lemon zest.

I know my oven gets hotter than what the dial says, so I always pre heat it and check it with an accurate thermometer before use. First time I got it to exactly 350 and put in pecans for 10 minutes. Pretty much turned to black with and ashey center. Like eating a burned match head. Tried again for only 5 minutes at about 295. Still inedible. So I reasoned why even do this if you're going to cook them in honey afterwards. Pecans are delicious right out of the shell anyway. So I took some and just cooked them in honey. Turned out pretty good, but not near as thickly coated or crisp as the ones from the store. I think the reason for that is the ones from the store list sugar as the first ingredient, which I was trying to avoid by making my own. I always thought honey was supposed to be far superior to sugar nutrient - wise bu after some reading found out it's not. The only advantage is it MAY help with allergies and is sweeter than sugar so you should need less. As far as calories and blood sugar reaction, it's about the same. As a result I've stopped using so much of it now. I hate it when you find out all these health food fads turn out to be bogus hype. Coconut oil is another one. It's a saturated fat.

I'm trying the same recipe for small chickens, I'll add more of the lemon, garlic and rosemary straight into the cavity. Will also increase the amount of sauce cuz i just LOVE the stuff!! I'm sad that its lost half a star rating. I used this recipe on Quail, I'm not sure what Cornish Hens are or how much fat they contain. But Quail hardly has any fat on it and you can probably use small roasting chickens and have the breast with some salad and roasted vegetables to make it a healthier option. In my opinion, anybody can take it upon themselves to make a meal healthy by opting for things such as Olive oil (about 2 Tbl-Sp/day helps to reduce cholesterol and unclog arteries), leaner meat, adding salads and veggies, substituting wine for water or broth and best of all, you don't have to sacrifice on flavor.

(helpful tips: these tender meatballs are braised not fried. if halving the meatball recipe, you will still need the full amount of stock for braising and for the gravy. the meatballs are somewhat delicate & time consuming to make; have someone help to form them into balls, it is much easier that way! for appetizers make them smaller and serve warm from the crock pot with toothpicks, buttered rolls and potato salad recipe #309891 #309891. freezes well).","ingredients":"ground sirloin', 'ground pork', 'ground veal', 'eggs', 'plain breadcrumbs', 'milk', 'white onion', 'lemon, zest of', 'lemon, juice of', 'capers', 'anchovy paste', 'butter', 'kosher salt', 'ground black pepper', 'flour', 'chicken stock', 'bay leaf', 'cider vinegar', 'dry white wine', 'black peppercorns', 'sour cream', 'fresh parsley'","review":"These muffins are great and easy to make...not sure what happened with Sarah M. when she made them.

If I had an option for more than 5 stars, i'd use it!  I got raves from everyone at the party.  I have never made a cheeseball before, because my husband doesn't like cheese, so i always have to disguise it in recipes and the word cheeseball does not lend itself to disguise very easily!  LOL\\nHe does, however, like cream cheese.  So when i found this recipe, i knew it would be a hit!  I have to tell everyone tho, that while shopping for the ingredients, specifically the graham crackers, i found a new kind of graham to use.  I originally knew that i would be using chocolate flavored grahams, but i also spotted the new Honey Maid Honey Stix.  They are PERFECT for the cheeseball!  The stix are the size and shape of small baby teething biscuits, are honey flavored with a little sugar sprinkled on top and are strong enough to scoop the cheeseball without breaking.  You can also purchase them in cinnamon flavor, which i will try next time (using both of the stix flavors and omitting the regular grahams altogether).  I loved this recipe so much that i am making it again for camping this weekend! \\nI could just go on and on raving about this recipe, but i won't.

This is such an amazing little recipe: not only does it allow me to now make Shepherd's Pie 100% more than I've made it in the past, but it also allows you to jazz it up with scraps of things you have left over! I used a 10 round deep pie pan; layered the browned ground beef that was cooked with a shallot and 2 cloves of garlic. Used an entire can (15 oz) of creamed corn with that size pan; then used 1/2 of a 15 oz. can of drained mixed vegetables over the creamed corn. Topped it off with the mashed potoates that I had added the last scraps of sour cream and grated cheese to when mashing. In 30 minutes in the oven, I had nicely browned and bubbling dinner for four. This will be made weekly during cold weather as my husband is Scottish and grew up eating Shepherd's Pie back in the U.K. I also believe that this would be a wonderful and easy recipe to use for teaching children how to cook; it is simple and goof-proof!

The barbecue sauce did not char at all, but did end up as a glaze, which added a lot of flavor.  I think the reason the burgers are so tender is because they are just ground chuck, so there is not much handling of it to mix in additional ingredients.  Since we are a cheeseburger bunch, I did add a slice of colby-jack cheese at the very end to melt slightly.

I had been to Magnolia Bakery in New York a few months back and had the banana pudding.  I usually would never order a banana dessert but have heard such rave reviews about it that I had to try it.  I was impressed and knew that I had to attempt making it.  I have the Magnolia Bakery cookbook at home so I found the right occassion to make it and I whipped it up!  It turned out PERFECT.  Absolutely wonderful and such a nice presentation. I like a subtle banana flavor and since the pudding part in this recipe is actually vanilla flavored and I didn't use super ripe bananas, it was very subtle.  If you wanted a stronger banana flavor, you could use more bananas and make sure they are plenty ripe (but not banana bread ripe - like almost black).  This dessert would be perfect for a picnic or barbeque.  It's not a fancy gourmet dessert by any means but just a good old fashioned southern pudding.  You must try to make this at least once.  I think you will be impressed and hooked.  I will definitely make it again.  Oh, in my cookbook it says to let the pudding sit in the fridge from 4-8 hours after assembling it. It says no more than 8 hours.  I let mine sit for 3 hours and it was fine and I've heard of people letting it sit for 12 hours and it was fine as well.
