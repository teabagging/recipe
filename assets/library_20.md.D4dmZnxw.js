I don't even know where to begin.  I get where some of you complain that there isn't enough spice.  It is a mild meatloaf.  First off, there has to be less tomato sauce and more bbq sauce or, use ketchup and bbq sauce combined.  Tomato sauce is too bland.  And a shake of garlic powder is completely useless here.  It was rediculously not enough.  I used 95% ground sirloin so there was not the grease factor here, but there was a lot of liquid I spilled out and that is from the tomato sauce.  It was mush, sliced mush.  It was a waste of good ground sirloin.  You have the right idea, but you got steered wrong with the bland tomato sauce.  I think if you use half a cup of ketchup or bbq or a mix of both would improve it immensely.  Also, I would recommend minced onions, dried or fresh.  What a waste of good meat.

As far as meatloaf goes, this really doesn't even resemble meatloaf as I know it in my neck of the woods. First, I save up old bread (all kinds) and toast and rip up for my meatloaf, 4 or 5 slices. I also add chopped onions and bell peppers, a handful of oats, thyme, a little oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper, Worchestire Sauce, and egg. I am in Texas and under no circumstance would BBQ sauce ever be put on a meatloaf. I consider Ketchup a major food group, but the idea of some weird, baked on tomato thing on top of a meatloaf is just gross! I know some people think it's like a required thing, but not for everyone.

I too subscribe to Cook's Country magazine and saw you had posted it here just when I direly needed it to fix for my friend and her husband after her kidney transplant. I almost perfectly halved the recipe, but added some of my favorites; fresh sliced mushrooms while sauteeing the onions, and some rutabaga, yam, and celery along with the carrots in the steam packet. I used 1 can of low sodium beef broth and about a cup of home-made gravy left from last night's dinner, and 1 tablespoon of the quick tapioca. I'm sure it came out just the consistency as you describe (coats the back of a spoon), and is wonderful for dipping dinner rolls...YUM! I left out the soy sauce because of the health problem and because I used the leftover gravy. I have a Corning large round crockpot, and it seems to run really hot. I started everything out on high, after 4 hours dumped the steamed vegies back in and let it just sit to get the gravy and veggies to blend, and the veggies were still holding together for packing, freezing and reheating.

It gets the grease out of the hot dogs, and also makes them curl up - for better tapeworm presentation.  Follow the rest of the recipe, also adding a dash of hot pepper seeds and 2 dashes of worchestershire.<br/>You also inspired my PETRIFIED WORMS.  I used 1# of hot dogs, cut in the same strips.

I only made a couple of tweaks to the recipe, more out of necessity than anything else: I used only un-bleached white all-purpose flour and a 10 oz bag of mini chocolate chips which, in my opinion, were plenty. Their mini size also suited the muffins nicely. The first batch of muffins took the full 20 minutes in the oven, 24 minutes the next batch and 23 for the last. Two muffin-making tricks I used were room-temperature ingredients and placing a cookie sheet under the muffin pan. Apparently this last trick prevents your muffins from turning brown on the bottom; I had no brown-bottomed muffins to speak of! These muffins are on the sweet side, which I like, so if you want something less sweet try substituting chopped walnuts for the chocolate chips or go halves with each. in any case, I will definitely be making these again!

I had surgery and could only have liquids, but wasn&#039;t allowed ice cold (had to avoid the &#039;brain freeze&#039;).  They suggested that I drink ENSURE meal replacement.  In a word-gross! I just couldn&#039;t get it down. My DH found this recipe - no ice!- , approved it with the surgeon&#039;s office and we were off!  I substituted the milk with the ENSURE and it was delish! We had to increase the ENSURE in the beginning to make it liquidy enough to easily drink with a straw.  Once I was allowed to drink from a glass we returned to 1/2 cup, and the thick and creamy texture was so satisfying.   As time went on, we switched up the flavours, using strawberry yogurt and ENSURE, and chocolate ENSURE.  They all tasted great, and I&#039;m sure this was one of the reasons that I healed so quickly.  I was back at work in 5 weeks instead of 8.  Even my surgeon&#039;s office said they would start adding this as a recommended option to help patients remain compliant to the liquid restriction.

Jollof rice is never a dish that you over-spice. There are way too many spices in this recipe.

Then add fresh tomatoes, if using, keep stiring every few minutes until dry. Add enough liquid stock (chicken, vegetable, of fish) for the qty of rice; stir, and leave to boil for 3-5 mins. Add curry, thyme, bay leaves, salt, stock cubes, and cover for a few mins. Add your fried/baked/boiled chicken breast/leg/fish/prawns or any type of meat, of choice. Then add already parboiled rice; mix it up and cover on high heat for the initial 10-15 mins; reduce heat and check on water level and the &quot;done-ess&quot;. 5 mins to end of cooking, add your veggies and cover and let the water dry gradually. Turn off heat, fluff/mix and leave on the stove covered and allow to cool down a bit. This is best enjoyed the next day.

And the closest I have found to the original Stella d'oro anisette sponge and toasts I used to get not only in flavor but in texture. They have the added benefit of being very easy to make, since there are no logs to form, and since they are soft when first removed from the oven, they won't crumble when you slice them. In fact, they come out so nicely sliced and even, they looked wonderful on my cookie tray for the holidays and made a very nice little gift when wrapped in festive holiday bags. I have also halved the recipe and made them in a 9 pan, adjusting for baking time. And they can be toasted a second time as long or as little as you prefer, so you can get the softer sponge texture rather than hard biscotti or toast texture easily. Excellent recipe, and one I highly recommend.\\n\\nI wanted to add this to my original review .... I had put these cookies on my Christmas Tray along with about 9 or 10 other kinds.  A friend who I had given a platter to told me someome in her family is having a fund-raiser dinner to help with some high medical bills.  I offered to donate some type of dessert or perhaps items they could package up and sell.  She thanked me and then asked if I could make these anise cookies.

Or, if you really love vanilla pudding, and want it in its liquid form, then this is definitely your recipe."},{"name":"peanut butter  n chocolate mini cheesecakes","steps":"preheat oven to 325', 'line 12 muffin cups with paper liners', 'spoon about 1 tablespoon crushed graham crackers into each cup and press with fingers to form crust', 'set aside', 'place cream cheese in mixer bowl', 'using speed 4 , beat until smooth , about 2 minutes', 'add sugar and vanilla', 'turn to speed 6 and beat until smooth and fluffy , about 1 minute', 'turn to speed 2', 'gradually add milk , then eggs , one at a time , beating 15 seconds after each addition', 'turn to speed 4 and beat mixture for 30 seconds', 'transfer half of batter to another bowl', 'add peanut butter to mixer bowl', 'on speed 4 , beat peanut butter mixture until well blended , about 1 minute', 'divide peanut butter mixture evenly among prepared lined muffin cups', 'return reserved batter to mixer bowl and add melted chocolate', 'turn to speed 4 and beat until well blended , about 1 minute', 'divide this mixture evenly among half-filled muffin cups , spreading to cover peanut butter batter', 'bake for 20-25 minutes , or until centers are almost set', 'cool completely on wire racks', 'store covered in refrigerator'","description":"in my world, there is nothing better than the flavors of pb and chocolate! if you live in the same world, you may agree and want to try this recipe for a delectable kick-your-feet-up dessert. i found this in my ka manual with steps listed as i found them. you may need to adjust the specifics if not a using a kitchen aid mixer.","ingredients":"chocolate-covered graham cracker cookies', 'cream cheese', 'sugar', 'vanilla extract', 'milk', 'eggs', 'peanut butter', 'semi-sweet chocolate chips'","review":"Thanks to the marinated artichokes and the yogurt mixed with the mayo, this was a nice tangy sandwich.

It was similar to others we have tried before, but adding a small amount of breadcrumbs to the pecans (instead of the other way around) was a nice change. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts (what I had on hand), reduced the cooking time to 20 minutes & the chicken was nice & moist. The pecan crusted chicken looked gorgeous after cooking & I was so caught up in plating & setting up the photo that I totally forgot about making the sauce! Luckily, it can be made super quickly in the microwave & it was delicious! DH & DS both started digging in before the sauce was made & loved it then. But they were blown away with the addition of the raspberry drizzle. We will be making this again.

One challenge in an all Splenda baked product is that slightly chemical taste that come with the lower calories.  To cut some of that, I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar Splenda (which is like a 1/2 cup of the white stuff) along with 3/4 cup of regular Splenda.
