Since there are only two of us, I halved the recipe. I did alter the original version and it still turned out wonderfully.   My changes resulted from the realization that I was out of nutmeg and heavy cream. So, deciding to go in a more savory direction, I added finely chopped onion, fresh garlic, and a couple of dashes of dried basil to the stuffing. As some of the other reviewers suggested, I chopped the mushrooms up well so that they would reduce to a finer texture, which eased spreading in the butterflied, tenderized, chicken breasts.  Since heavy cream was not available, I improvised by making a basic b\\\\xe9chamel sauce. Before adding the flour and milk, I saut\\\\xe9ed a very thinly sliced mushroom in the butter. I finished the sauce by stirring in about a tablespoon of dried basil before pouring over the stuffed breasts.   I served this as shown in the photo, sliced into rounds with additional sauce drizzled over them; a beautiful presentation that tasted just as good as it looked. The warm tones of the basil playing against the savory mushroom onion stuffing were absolute heaven.  This is definitely going into my regular rotation.

I also do not recommend that anyone eat pot roast rare as suggested by a reviewer. Pot roast is a very tough cut and the long braising and fall apart result is what a pot roast is all about. I would recommend that you salt and pepper the roast before browning because I thought it needed a bit more salt. I would also suggest that you use a grainy or country dijon and NOT a sweetened dijon mustard. The only changes that I made was that I used dark brown sugar because that is all I had. I cooked it covered tightly in a 275 degree oven for 4 hours and it  turned out perfect. I did have to add more slurry to thicken the gravy because of all the juices that I had left. Next time I might stir a few crumbled ginger snaps into the gravy to give it an even more pronounced german flavor.  This is a winner and I will make this again and again.
