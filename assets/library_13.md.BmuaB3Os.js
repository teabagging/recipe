Taking out the beef and letting it sit on a plate or cutting board until cool is a most if you want authentic thin-sliced beef, rather than shredded.  After slicing, do not put into the hot jus until ready to serve, or it will get tough if it continues cooking IMO.  By far, however, shredding is the faster way of having quick and easy sandwiches.  I do not add salt at all because of salty dressing packets.  You can always mix in garlic salt after everything is done if you need it.  If you don't like somewhat-hot giardinara relish or pepperocini peppers on the sandwiches as is usually done in Chicago, sauteed green peppers are are also used.  I make a time-consuming version of authentic Chicago Italian Beef , but this by far is a lot less hassle and gives you a taste of Chicago.. 2/2/10:   Over time, I have made this as directed, which was good.  I then modified recipe by omitting the salts, using 2 envelopes of ranch dressing, and added 1 can unsalted beef broth and water to make 3 cups.  As others did, I put in crockpot for 10 hours then placed beef on a plate to firm up and sliced beef thinly before returning to jus and serving.

Just No!\\n\\nProper Italian Beef as they serve at Portillo&#039;s and elsewhere is NOT cooked in a slow cooker and shredded!\\n\\nHere&#039;s a proper Italian Beef Recipe:\\n\\nYou want to start with a nice, lean Top Round roast - as big as you like (or small ... but why?).  Make a seasoning mix of 2T each kosher salt and black pepper, and 1 T each of garlic powder, oregano and basil.  Mix up well and then sprinkle generously over the meat, reserving the rest.\\n\\nHeat the oven to 325 and a cast iron skillet to screaming hot. You need also a large roasting pan with a rack that has at least 3/4 inch clearance under it, or use 1 in thick onion slices as &quot;stilts&quot; to set your roast on (my favorite method!).\\n\\nBrown the meat on all sides in the skillet, then place in the roasting pan on the rack or onion stilts.  Add low-sodium beef broth to the pan until it just touches the bottom of the meat.  Stir in 1t of the seasoning mix. Roast until 125 degrees in the center - yup, that&#039;s rare. Stay with me!  Remove the roasting pan from the oven, wrap the meat in foil and set on a warm platter to rest.  Pour the broth from the roaster into a sauce pan and skim any fat off the top.  Warm the broth just to a simmer and then taste - if it needs to be saltier and more seasoned, add more seasoning mix in small amounts until it is awesome.  BTW, if short on gravy, just add more beef broth and then season it up with the mix. Wait until the meat has rested 20 minutes.  \\n\\nSlice the meat across the grain in very thin slices - a meat slicer machine works best but absent of that, a very sharp thin knife or electric knife will do - and stack it up on the platter.  To make the best sandwiches ever, take a generous portion of the sliced meat with tongs and dunk it into the simmering broth for anywhere from 15 seconds (to keep it medium rare) to a minute or so (for medium well) and then put it on a nice section of french bread - ideally Chicago&#039;s own Gonnella bread.

I accidently put in ground coriander seed instead of ground cardamon but after some sniffing at some whole cardamon pods, I don't think there was a huge difference in taste. The 750ml of flour seems to be more of starting point for the amount of flour to add as I had to add a lot more flour to get it even to a somewhat sticky dough. I always have problems rolling out yeast doughs to be very thin so I think my dough only made it to 30cm by 50cm rather than the 70cm it says in the recipe. After making this recipe I discovered that finnish cinnamon rolls are baked on end, not with the swirly side flat on the tray. Even with all these problems I created for myself, these came out wonderful! Don't be scared of the cardamon in the dough because I couldn't taste the ground coriander in the dough at all.

Big Batch of Chocolate Chip Cookies is a very appropriate title for this recipe.  I got 151 cookies from the batch using a 1 cookie scoop.  Which is great.  I was getting tired of making cookies every 1-2 weeks for lunches.  A regular batch makes 2-3 dozen.  If you figure I lose at least a half dozen and usually a dozen before I can get them into the freezer I needed something that makes more.\\nI am rating this recipe on two things, taste and directions.\\nThe good news is the taste is really good.  Based on the previous review I doubled the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I baked at 350 for 10 minutes and got soft and chewy cookies which is what my family likes.  Even when cooled these cookies remain soft.  My husband noted they had a creamier texture that regular chocolate chip cookies.  Really on taste for my family I would have given this 5 stars.\\nThat brings me to the directions themself which are not good.  First I found the ingredients list out of order and difficult to follow.  The directions do not specify what size pudding mix to use, so I used 5 oz boxes.  My cookies were fine so I assume that was correct.  In addition, no where in the directions does it say where to add the pudding.  I ended up sifting it with the flour and baking soda.  I was concerned about the lack of salt, but there appears to be enough salt in the pudding to make up for it.  Finally, the amount of chocolate chips was a bit confusing the recipe calls for 3 (108) packages of chocolate chips.  I used 3 - 12 oz packages of semi sweet chocolate chips.  This came to 36 ounces total.  I felt the chocolate chip ratio was perfect.  108 oz of chocolate chips would be 9 - 12 oz packages I don't think that would work.\\nOverall I would give a 5 star for the taste and living up to the name, but a 2 star for the directions.

There seem to be other recipes here for Shrimp with lemon and angel hair pasta which have the sauce made less stringent by having chicken stock and white wine. Without those last two ingredients in this version the lemon zest and juice completely overwhelms and swamps the taste of the shrimp.&lt;br/&gt;Here in the UK we call large Shrimps &quot;Prawns&quot; and our shrimps are so small they&#039;re hardly worth the trouble of preparation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I bought large prawns that had been shelled and so frying them in the pan soon turned them pink. I stuck to the recipe for red pepper flakes and black pepper etc but the overpowering lemon taste meant the prawns lost any seafood flavour and didn&#039;t even taste of shellfish.&lt;br/&gt;I know the prawns have more flavour because in a rice dish like Nasi Goreng Indonesian fried rice they taste exquisite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angel hair pasta is really what seems to be rice noodles which I&#039;m not keen on, as they are so starchy but fresh spaghetti makes a good substitute. Certainly I think lemon juice should be used only as a sprinkled garnish on fish or on shellfish salads and not be used as a stock to cook such delicate flavours in.  Another thing that kills the flavour of shellfish is strong mature cheese. But that&#039;s just my British taste. I don&#039;t find hot chillies spoil shellfish unless it&#039;s really overdone.&lt;br/&gt;I give this one 4 stars as we did enjoy it albeit with a tinge of disappointment over the dominant lemon.

In step 5 when the tomatoes are added and brought to a boil, there was very little if any liquid to boil. There is a certain complexity here that I do not understand: why simmer the wine in step 6 for ten minutes and then add the thyme and basil for another 5 minutes?  There were not enough ingredients to warrant 15 minutes of simmering.  I would suggest simmering the wine for maybe 6 minutes and adding the thyme and basil just before the chicken is returned.

I used broccoli slaw mix rather than coleslaw mix - just a personal preference. No granny smith apples so I used honeycrisp. I didn't have the OJ concentrate so I just used fresh OJ. I had my doubts about the sauce when I first tasted it - the mayo flavor was very strong and the orange flavor was very faint! For sure, this definitely needs some marrying time in the refrigerator - I chilled about 1.5 hours. The end result was a refreshing and light tasting dreamsicle flavored slaw - DELICIOUS. The pecans added quite a bit to the flavor and texture. I will definitely make this again and I hope you don't mind the modifications I chose. Thanks so much for posting - I absolutely love this!

I have tried a different recipe from a cookbook for the same general dish, and that was really heavy and awful. This recipe was MUCH better. The cornstarch makes a big difference -- it makes the tofu brown quickly and I think it may keep the oil in the crust instead of it being absorbed by the tofu, so the tofu stays creamy. Also, heating the peanut sauce helped make it smooth and helped the flavors to meld. The only thing I changed was that I used a smallish clove of garlic, minced very fine, rather than garlic powder. As I also used chunky peanut butter, it didn't change the texture at all. I thought it appropriate to fry the tofu in peanut oil.

Enter Sarasota's recipe and her Grandma, who must have been a wizard in the kitchen! I tied the two recipes together, using shell macaroni and green onions but made everything else according to Sarasota's recipe. I know that she recommended waiting for it to cool, but my family was hanging around me like jackal's so it was served while still warm. Twenty minutes later, there was ONLY enough left over to submit a photograph, and once that was taken, the remainder went into my son's mouth! LOL The dill is a touch of genius and the other ingredients, although common, combine to make a stellar Tuna Macaroni Salad. I want to try this with salmon and sub out capers for the pickles; I think that would be a Keeper, too. This is one recipe that has become an instant classic in our home.

I boiled the beans together with the sugar and vanilla. When serving I put a small portion of beans in a bowl, barely coating them with water and added about a tablespoon of the coconut milk. Then I added a little more sugar, tasting as I went along to get the sweetness right. With a little tweaking this recipe came out great. Next time I will try the pandan leaves or tamarind paste to get a more exotic flavor. The recipe says to serve the soup hot, but I\\\\'ve tried it both ways and I prefer it cold.

I used Kraft's Brown Sugar BBQ sauce, which we find comparable to Bull's Eye. It too has a liquid smoke flavouring,so hubby and I pretty much agreed that the BBQ sauce pretty much overpowered the other spices & the bacon,(although the bacon was good for texture.) So, I might be tempted to just skip those ingredients next time. However, it may be worth a try with a very mild(or less?) BBQ sauce. You could probably even make this dish without the BBQ sauce and still have something very tasty. Hubby thought that mushrooms would be good under the cheese, probably because it would then be similar to something he does, sometimes when we are just having plain BBQ chicken breasts, he will put mushrooms & onions on top and melt cheese over it for a little change.  The green onions & tomatoes on top dressed this up nicely. We had this with Mashed red potatoes with garlic & parmesan by Mizz Nezz and green & yellow beans with baby carrots and we enjoyed a very nice meal in both taste & presentation!
