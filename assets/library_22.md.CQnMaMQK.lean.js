Please do not think I changed it, but instead of black pepper I added a little dried crushed red pepper flakes. I kept the heads on my shrimps, purely because (according to better cooks than me) it adds to the end flavour. (In South Africa shrimps, better known as prawns, are almost always served shell and head on, and the best tasting ones come from Mozambique. In this case those were not available, and I used Indian farmed prawns which are fairly tastless! But I did peel the bodies). Your sauce cannot be faulted. The balance of flavours is perfect. I did add a little water when simmering the sauce, purely because I think I had more shrimp than your specified 1 lb, and the sauce was not quite enough. I made brown basmati rice, and not white rice. This was a delicious meal, and I cannot understand why your recipe has so far gone unnoticed!!  Thanks for posting, we had a delicious dinner!

The olives couldn't really be tasted per se but they give it an earthier flavor. I mixed up about an equal amount of frozen corn with my black beans, and stirred in a bit of salsa to that. When my pasta was ready, I stirred maybe 3/4s cup of salsa into it and then put that in the casserole dish, followed by the meat mixture, some shredded cheese, then the bean/corn mix, and some more cheese. Overall, I think I only used a bit over a cup of salsa and about 3/4s cup of cheese. It was easy, worked out witih the make-ahead schedule, and was filling, hearty, colorful, and not too unhealthy.

I also browned the burger (I always use ground turkey) with the same spices I use to season my taco meat and it's all to taste- some garlic powder, chili powder, a bunch of paprika, chili pepper flakes, pepper, onion flakes. I also added some frozen corn. I used a campanelle pasta, which held the sauce beautifully. The one thing I have to say about this recipe is that it's only as good as your salsa, since there's so much of it. We were lucky and had lots of homemade salsa on hand - 4 cups is a lot of salsa, even for us who eat it more than ketchup.

I made and then tasted straight away and it was not very flavourful, I then refrigerated for a few hours and the flavour was very good.. I did add some sweet chilli sauce to the dipping sauce once I had taken the photo as I prefer a little thicker dipping sauce rather than one that is very liquidy, but I will say flavour wise after the few hours was very good.. The patties themselves were packed with flavour and so good even if you never made the dipping sauce to go with them, but having it as an accompaniment just sent the dish over the edge..

The flavors all worked really well together and overall we enjoyed it.  \\n\\nI might try some things differently if I made it again, however.  We didn't like some of the textures. The strawberries were mushy, and the bread on top was too hard and crunchy.  I might leave the top layer of bread off if I made this again since there's no way for it to stay moist during baking.

It did have a lot of ingredients though, and many strong flavored ones, so a bit overpowering for gnocchi. We love each one of these ingredients individually; my favorite parts with the gnocchi were the artichoke hearts, basil and garlic (which I let sit in the oil and vinegar while everything else was prepared). We did not use the reserved 1/3 cup of oil, we prefer much less, so the one tablespoon plus drained artichokes was plenty for us. I think pine nuts would make a good sub for the walnuts.
