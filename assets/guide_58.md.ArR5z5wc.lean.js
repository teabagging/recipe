Too many short cuts and swap-outs made here for this to be successful. Olive oil will NOT do here. You need BUTTER to make this work. And New potatoes are not appropriate for this recipe. You need the high starch content of Russet potatoes, along with the butter, to make the scales stick to the fish, and do NOT rinse the potatoes after cutting. Pat the slices dry and submerge them in melted butter before arranging as scales on the fish. This technique is not easy to pull off. It's hard to get the potatoes to stick to the fish even under the best of conditions. This recipe came out of the kitchen of a master chef, so shortcuts can't be taken in an effort to reduce this to &quot;everyday cooking,&quot; 'cause it ain't that. Google this before attempting this recipe.

This was about twice as much oil as necessary for the amount of vegetables. Olive oil is solid at refrigerator temperatures, so perhaps another oil would mix better in a chilled soup. 3. The chicken stock is most of the recipe volume, so it really drives the taste, texture, and color. Probably it should be a clear stock, well-de-fatted.

Due to a few ingred shortages and making this just for me I cut this down to serve 2 (it might actually serve more than that because i didn't measure/weigh my spaghetti, but measured everything else). I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and added 3/4 of a large carrot, shredded and half of a large red pepper, thinly julienned. My sesame seeds were already toasted, and toasting the sesame seeds really adds to this dish. I added enough of the red pepper and carrot to taste it, too, and these went well with the dressing. I did not have chili oil, but I had Mild Sweet Chili Sauce, so this dish isn't as hot as it might be, but still extremely tasty and very addicting! I followed the rest of the recipe as stated. I've saved the leftover sliced green onion and some sesame seeds in separate containers to take with me for lunch tomorrow. I can't wait to find out what this tastes like after being in the fridge overnight. Thank you for a wonderful cold asian salad; and a great snack in the middle of the night (or morning or whatever). Anyway I'm going to finish eating this and try to go to bed, lol! Definitely going into my tried and loved file. Would make a great side dish for chicken. :) 10 stars!  ETA:  Ate the rest of this for my lunch today and it was just as fantastic, all the flavors went so well together and I had compliments on it too!  I liked using the sweet chili sauce, even though it wasn't the same as chili oil, because the heat was very mild, but still there, and the sweet part did not overpower, but was balanced well with the rest of the ingreds.

I used 1 egg and 2 egg whites to lighten it a bit and it came to 3 weight watchers points vs. 4 with the two eggs.  I also used a different frosting than the one used here (it was the one used on the show); there seems to be like 3 different versions of the frosting out there.  I used 3 egg whites, pinch of salt, 1 cup confectioner's sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar.  I also added a squeeze of lemon juice, a drop of vanilla extract, and I scraped some vanilla beans from the pod.  The key to the frosting is NOT to overbeat it-just beat it until the stiff peaks form and LEAVE it alone-put it in the fridge for 30 minutes and frost the completely cooled cupcakes.  The frosting does not taste like buttercream like Rachel on the show said (more like marshmellow fluff); however it is very good.  There is another recipe for the frosting that calls for 3 tablespoons butter so if you are looking for a buttercream type frosting, I would try googling cook yourself thin cupcakes butter.\\n\\nThese cupcakes would also be good without frosting but I am a frosting freak.  Oh and I was concerned about getting pieces of zucchini in my cupcakes or big chunks of almond so I made the whole thing in the food processor.  I put about a 1/4 cup almonds in the food processor with 2 tablespoons of the flour called for so I wouldn't get nut butter (make sure you get 8 tablespoons plus 2-8 for the 1/2 cup and 2 for the 2 of flour you added in).  I then added the rest of the dry.  In a separate bowl I peeled the zucchini with a regular peeler (wasn't very fine) and then added the eggs and vanilla extract.  I added that all into the very fine mix of flour, almonds, baking powder (takes care of shifting for you too).  I then pulsed it and blended for a few seconds until well mixed (don't want to overbeat or you will get tough cupcakes).  I then added it in the tins and baked it 18 minutes (it could have used a minute less but it depends on your oven). Flip the tins around at 10 minutes and check it at 16.  The tops should spring back when lightly touched or a toothpick should come out clean when inserted.\\n\\nThese were a little more work than the average baked good but they are really worth it.  And like I said, they were very filling-I actually ate half of one last night and half just before.\\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"lemon dijon asparagus","steps":"cook asparagus in boiling water until crisp-tender or as desired', 'in a small saucepan , melt butter', 'add lemon juice , mustard and worcestershire sauce , salt and pepper', 'place asparagus in serving dish , drizzle with butter mixture and toss to coat'","description":"another easy asparagus dish. fast and tasty. nice sprinkled with fresh chives.","ingredients":"asparagus', 'butter', 'lemon juice', 'dijon mustard', 'worcestershire sauce', 'salt and pepper'","review":"I followed this recipe to a tee, but it was just plain disappointing.

I always wanted to find a recipe for lemon rice. I tried this recipe and it worked out for me. I made some little changes. I bought a lemon olive oil from Italy and mixed it in with the butter. I also used lemon pepper spice and oregano leaves. I added a little bit more lemon juice just to make sure it had the flavor and used a little less chicken broth. As for the chicken broth, I just heating the water in the micro and added a chicken broth cube into it and mixed. This is what I used. So everything was fairly easy to prepare. The hardest part was probably watching the rice in the butter so that it wouldn't burn or turn brown. Something you have to keep your eye on. Thanks so much for your recipe.

A little sweet and a little tangy and perfectly tender even though I didn't have any meat tenderizer to add to the marinade and I over cooked it to an almost well-done temperature.  I used a reduced-sugar ketchup that is made with Splenda and it worked perfectly.  I froze the London broil in the marinade and thawed in the refrigerator for 2 days.  I rinsed the meat before cooking to avoid the possibility of burning the bits of garlic under the broiler.  We don't have a grill so I cooked this using a method I learned from Alton Brown.  Turn the oven's broiler on and place the racks at the bottom positions.  Put the steak directly on the top rack and place a foil lined pan on the bottom rack to catch drips.  I cooked the steak for 5 minutes on each side and then moved the racks to the top positions in the oven and cooked for 3 minutes per side directly under the broiler.  Like I said though, it was cooked to almost well-done and although it was still very tender next time I'll reduce the cooking time to achieve a medium temperature.
