I asked DH if I could use his battered old but perfect coffee grinder (if you know the Dutch and their coffee you will understand his unreasonable attachment to this little machine) and while he agreed and said *he* would do it... he hasn't bought himself to actually put rice into his beloved coffee grinder yet.(I may have to touch the treasured possession myself !!!)I had one lime, but felt that the flavour was so good that maybe two would have been better ? I will experiemt more once I have the full compliment of chilies and other ingredients and let you know what ends up being our favourite.

The other branches of the government, FSA and USDA did not classify them as wheat- probably because they did not want to insure them. It was late November of 2005 that the FDA made their decision to call them wheat. The decision was not based on any scientific findings like they contributed to allergies or digestive disorders. The finding was based on scientific nomenclature. To this day as a matter of fact, science has not proven that gluten is the protein that causes wheat allergies.

Wheat hulls were originally very difficult to remove by threshing.  The spelt was modified to make the hulls easier to remove and make it more economical to grow and harvest.  Spelt hulls were more nutritious than the wheat hulls are now today and spelt was almost lost to the more modern types of wheat because of the cheaper way they can process the modern type.  You will find little information these days that mentions that Spelt is actually a type of wheat because of all the hype of using it to replace wheat for people who are sensitive to gluten but that should not be the case because it even though there is some gluten in it, it does not affect most people who are intolerant to gluten.  If you visit most of the sites that sell Spelt, they never mention Wheat....they don&#039;t even say it&#039;s Not wheat because it Is wheat.   They just want to sell their product and don&#039;t want to have to go into detail about why &quot;this&quot; type of wheat should be safe for gluten free diets....and it is.    Agriculturists know what it is though.....and it IS a wheat subspecies and a very good one.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelt"},{"name":"lazy man cannoli pie","steps":"combine ricotta cheese , sugar , vanilla and orange rind in a medium bowl', 'whisk until thoroughly combined', 'melt chocolate chips in the microwave or in a double boiler', 'mix 1 / 3 cup melted chocolate with 1 / 2 of ricotta mixture', 'spread into prepared crust', 'top with plain ricotta mixture and drizzle with remaining melted chocolate', 'refrigerate overnight until firm'","description":"this is too easy to make for such a delicious result. gourmet club loved it.","ingredients":"whole milk ricotta cheese', 'sugar', 'vanilla', 'orange rind', 'chocolate chips', 'oreo cookie pie crusts'","review":"I did half unbleached flour, half spelt and added 2 tbsp of ground flax... it was delicious!

A doubled recipe fed 2 adults, 2 teens, and a toddler. The use of both regular and sundried tomatoes made it nice and rich too. But it didn't quite live up to its potential because the flavor was rather one-dimensional. IMO, it needs garlic and another herb, perhaps oregano, to add depth and complexity. Additionally, DH complained that the cayenne on top was like finding landmines -- it might have been better added along with the basil so that the flavors would meld. It would have been a 4-star though except that the author messed up the fresh-to-dried basil conversion. Even using the regular conversion of 1 tsp dried basil for each tbs fresh the flavor was overpowering. If I'd used 6 tablespoons of dried basil in the doubled batch it would have been like eating pesto out of the jar with a spoon. In a regular review I'd just have noted the error and given it the 4 stars but since its a contest entry I can't rate it as highly as I'd rate a recipe that written correctly.

We all really liked the flavor of the sauce, despite the runniness of it, even though my husband thought an element of heat would be a nice touch. Just wanted to let others know that you wouldn't get great results in a crockpot. I definitely plan to make this again and follow the directions next time.  Revisiting my review to add the 5 stars!  Made as directed and it was still thinner than I anticipated but so good that I didn't really mind.  I will make this often I'm sure (especially if my boys have anything to say about it)."},{"name":"lean shepherd s pie","steps":"pre-heat the oven to 140c or 275 degrees f', 'place the onion , swede and carrots into the bowl of a food processor', 'then add the cinnamon , herbs and flour and whiz everything until it is all finely chopped but stop before it turns into a pure', 'place it all in a casserole dish , add the beef and season generously with salt and pepper', 'next mix the tomato pure and stock together in a jug , stir this into the casserole and give it a good mix', 'place the casserole over a gentle heat and bring it up to simmering point', 'cover with the lid and place it in the pre-heated oven on the centre shelf to cook for 2 hours', 'about 30 minutes before the time is up , peel the potatoes , cut them into even-sized chunks and place them in a saucepan', 'pour boiling water over , add some salt , cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until they are tender when pierced with a skewer', 'drain the potatoes , cover with a clean tea cloth for 5 minutes to absorb the steam , then , start to mash the potatoes , gradually adding the quark , milk and a seasoning of salt and freshly milled black pepper and continuing to whisk until the potatoes are light and fluffy', 'at this point remove the casserole from the oven and increase the temperature to 200c or 400f', 'cover the meat mixture evenly with the mashed potato', 'now slice the leek lengthways into four and chop each length into 1 / 4 inch slices', 'rinse and dry them , then cover the potato with chopped leek , pressing them gently into the surface', 'finally cover the leeks with grated cheddar and then sprinkle with the parmesan', 'return the dish to the oven on a high shelf for 25 minutes or until the top is golden and crusty'","description":"this is a take on delia smith's light version of shepherd's pie. the difference with this recipe is that the meat is roasted in the oven, instead of being fried.","ingredients":"ground beef', 'onion', 'parsnip', 'carrots', 'ground cinnamon', 'fresh thyme', 'fresh parsley', 'plain flour', 'tomato puree', 'vegetable stock', 'salt & freshly ground black pepper', 'potatoes', 'quark', '1% low-fat milk', 'leeks', 'reduced-fat cheddar cheese', 'parmesan cheese'","review":"I've made this several times now and really like this recipe.

Also used one 15 oz. tin of Hunt&#039;s tomato sauce, one tin of Campbell s tomato soup and some left over tomato sauce from another recipe (about a cup and a half). Also maybe a cup and a half or more of water. Was very tasty and will make again - BUT I also used the cup and a half of catchup called for in the recipe. Came out too sweet for my family&#039;s taste, although we did like it, but would like it more with less sweetness. Will cut the catchup down to maybe 1/2 cup or leave it out altogether next time. Only had slightly less than 1 cup of sour cream on hand (200 grams, where cup is 230 grams), so used that with heaping tablespoon of flour. Worked fine, although I saved enough sauce without the sour cream (just undert 3 cups) for another go at this recipe.

The overall flavor was similar to the white dip I've had before, but not close enough for me to make this recipe as-is again.  My mom liked it but said it didn't taste the same as the restaurant version.

But my son loved the white dip, so I am trying to replicate it at home. This dip was really close. I am used to the white dip having a more ranchy taste than a Miracle Whippy taste so I increased the ranch so it was a cup of each. I also increased the amount of cayenne &amp; red pepper (I even threw in a dash of black pepper) as we like ours zippy. I substituted a splash of regular milk for the cream as I don't usually keep cream in the house. And I upped the onion powder to a 1/2 tsp. It ended up making a literal vat of dip.

I am SO GLAD that I finally made this!! I was starving and I was so tired with my exam papers that I needed to take a break, and what better way than try a recipe from you:) I thought about this one and a pao-bhaji craving took on...in the next few minutes, I was busy making this. One thing that's a must for this recipe is to grate the cauliflower and chop the carrots into very fine pieces. As I was really starved, I didn't care to really chop the carrots all that small, and the end result wasn't very good, so I promised myself to take care of that next time. In step 4, when adding the potatoes to the chana dal, I added a tsp. of salt. In future, I'll add the juice of 1 lemon (in step 6) as well as half a cup of finely chopped fresh corriander leaves. I also found that step 8 is not required. I omitted the addition of oil in step 17(we usually add butter on the pao) because I'm really not all that crazy for it(as you know, I'm trying to pull down). I strongly suggest removing the whole red chilli before serving (step 11) because tonight when we were enjoying this, suddenly mom got this into her mouth and I had to say, Egg on my face. LOL. What I liked alot about this recipe is that it was very mildly spicy. At my place, I'm so used to eating very spicy pao-bhaji, this was a well-deserved change;-) \\nAnother thing I enjoyed immensely was the coolness of a fresh sliced tomato and the heat of the bhaji! EXCELLENT COMBO! Mom has suggested to keep a few slit green chillies and few sliced onions in a bowl at the side of the serving bowl when this is served, so, if anyone wants, they can enjoy these on the side with the bhaji.

I used pumpkin that I froze last year and it worked out extremely well. I had a slice of this with coffee for breakfast. It made a terrific start to my morning.

Rolled them in cinnamon and sugar and they were perfect for the midnight snack."},{"name":"lemon and white chocolate mousse parfaits with strawberries","steps":"whisk egg yolks , sugar , lemon juice , lemon peel , and salt in medium metal bowl to blend', 'set bowl over saucepan of simmering water', 'whisk until mixture is very thick and thermometer inserted into center registers 160f to 170f , about 6 minutes', 'remove bowl from over water', 'cool lemon mousse base to room temperature', 'combine 1 / 4 cup cream and white chocolate in another medium metal bowl', 'set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water', 'stir constantly until chocolate is soft and almost melted', 'remove bowl from over water and stir until white chocolate is melted and smooth', 'cool white chocolate mousse base to room temperature', 'beat remaining 2 2 / 3 cups cream in large bowl until firm peaks form', 'divide whipped cream between both mousse bases , folding in 1 cup at a time', 'layer scant 1 / 4 cup lemon mousse in each of 8 parfait glasses or wineglasses', 'top with 2 tablespoons strawberries', 'layer scant 1 / 4 cup white chocolate mousse over strawberries', 'repeat layering 1 more time', 'do ahead can be made 1 day ahead', 'cover with plastic wrap and chill', 'cover and chill remaining strawberries'","description":"published in bon appetit 2009.  http://www.bonappetit.com/magazine/2009/04/lemon_and_white_chocolate_mousse_parfaits_with_strawberries\\nprep time is a guess.","ingredients":"egg yolks', 'sugar', 'fresh lemon juice', 'lemon peel', 'salt', 'heavy whipping cream', 'white chocolate', 'strawberries'","review":"It was ok, not wonderful or good.  texture was fine.

I wanted a simple recipe with ingredients I had in the house--these were sooo good!  They definitely need more flour than the recipe calls for and I let them rise for a little longer than 30 min.  After they came out of the fryer I brushed a little butter on them and covered them in cinnamon sugar.  They tasted like elephant ears you get at the fair!  Yum!

My hubby's only suggestion is that next time I make the dough a little sweeter so I'll add a few more spoons of sugar but I personally loved them as it.

They were very easy but they did seem a bit....flat.  Some of mine that I had worked more (the scraps I kneaded together then cut out others) seemed to raise better.  Also-I didn't know how thick to roll.  I left them for about 1 hour and they were MUCH better than only 30 min. Texture ended up OK though.  Much over 1 hr rising was too much as they ended up not firm enough to work with.  I too used almost 3 cups of flour using my mixer with dough hook.  I left out the cinnamon as we aren't huge fans.  I fried 1-2 at a time in my fry daddy using a skewer to turn and move them.  I cut them with my biggest round buscuit cutter (3) and used my apple corer for the holes, it worked great!  <br/><br/>I glazed with a simple powdered sugar and milk glaze.  I found that warming up the glaze (I put in a double boiler/glass bowl over almost simmering water) made it work great!  I was able to  dip them then leave on a wire rack to drip off.<br/>The taste was OK.  Not knocking me over though.  I was trying to find one that replicates our local small town bakery.  Not quite."},{"name":"lemon angel bars","steps":"heat oven to 350', 'beat cake mix and water in extra-large glass or metal bowl on low speed for 30 seconds', 'beat on medium speed for 1 minute', 'add lemon pie filling and mix well', 'pour into ungreased 15x10 jelly roll pan', 'bake 25 minutes', 'cool and frost'","description":"this is a quick low-fat 3-ingredient recipe that turns out amazing. i have been asked for this recipe many times.","ingredients":"angel food cake mix', 'water', 'lemon flavor instant pudding and pie filling', 'lemon frosting'","review":"Now I&#039;m a fussy food lover, coming from a history of top cooks in 5 star hotel ones, so I rate my taste buds as above average, this recipe was my first attempt at doughnuts and everyone who tasted them raved, no jokes like aawww so good please make me a whole lot etc, they froze and reheated excellently. I noticed when fresh ie same time cooked they have a distinguished sour taste but after freezing and reheating this sour taste goes away, possibly the yeast needs to die? Thanks so much I got 40 small doughnuts from one mix. I have made these twice now.
