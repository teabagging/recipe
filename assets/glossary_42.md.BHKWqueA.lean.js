I think that it should be specified as to how thick these 'cube steaks' are supposed to be, and how big, because I got a disgusting, oozing, gross mess of garbage that took me an hour and a half to make and 2 seconds to throw away, because they tasted horrible.  We ended up going out for dinner.  I have A LOT of experience cooking, so I am 100% certain that the results were not due to some kind of error on my part.

Having grilled marianted cube steak before I knew the meat would be very delicate and needed to be handled with great care. I marinated my cube staeks in low sodium teriyaki for about 4 hours. I VERY carefully removed them and set them one at a time on paper toweling. I very carefully spread the cream cheese and then sprinkled it with garlic powder. You must also roll them with great care, or the cube steak will fall apart. To wrap with bacon, I laid the strip down on one end of the rolled steak, and twisted the bacon around it by rolling the steak on an angle. I very carefully inserted the toothpick and repeated the process. Again, from past experience with cube steak on the grill, I cooked them on a piece of heavy duty foil, turning them carefully with tongs. They really do take longer than 5 minutes per side....more like 10-15 minutes per side.\\nThese are an absolute flavor sensation and if you handle the meat with care, you will be rewarded to a lovely entree."},{"name":"chele d s shrimp creole","steps":"in a deep skillet or dutch oven , brown onion and bell pepper in bacon grease over med head for about 10 minutes', add garlic and saute another couple of minutes , you don't want to brown the garlic, 'add everything else to the pan , except for the shrimp', 'simmer for 30 minutes or so , until flavors meld', 'add shrimp and simmer for about 10 more minutes or until shrimp are cooked through', 'serve over rice'","description":"i found several recipes on zaar for shrimp creole, but none of them was what i was looking for.  i just came up with my own twist and it was inhaled by all--even the kids.","ingredients":"shrimp', 'bacon grease', 'onion', 'green bell pepper', 'garlic cloves', 'bay leaves', 'diced tomatoes', 'tomato sauce', 'hot sauce', 'worcestershire sauce', 'water', 'vegetable bouillon', 'dried thyme', 'sugar'","review":"My family loved this:) I marinated in Stubbs cause hubby couldn't find the moores and I cooked it in the oven for about half an hour or so at 400 degrees.

Instead of the first breading with bread crumbs, I did the first breading with seasoned flour. I don't think it made a whole lot of difference, as the last breading gave the scallops a decent amount of crumbs. I did that because I wanted to contain the juices as much as possible, as the scallops were not totally thawed. It did work! This method of cooking is not very unique, but it is very effective.  It is an excellent way to keep the juices in the meat and give a nice browed crunchy crust. I really liked it. (I did use Italian seasoned commercial bread crumbs, so that added to the flavor.) Because I had potatoes in the oven, I started it out at 425 degrees, then after removing the potatoes, kicked it up to 500 degrees. I totally skipped the 30 minutes rest time. My scallops probably only got about 5-10 minutes rest. Nevertheless, it worked out just fine. If you are looking for a nicely moist scallop, this will give it to you.

I do think the recipe is a good one, but the sweetened condensed milk just doesn't have the same caramel taste that using wrapped caramels would.  I used the stove-top, double boiler method for cooking the caramel.  It simmered (hard) for over 90 minutes and I still didn't have a dark, sticky caramel.  I wish I had used the microwave, but at the time I had both ovens, the microwave & two burners going with other recipes, so letting the milk simmer on it's own for an hour & a half seemed like a fine idea.  In the future, I will try it again using the microwave and making sure to cook it until the full caramel stage.  I think, after spending more than two hours on this recipe, for just the first two layers, I was wanting to love them.  However, without the dark, rich caramel, they don't taste enough like a Twix, the caramel doesn't support the chocolate layer & they're difficult to cut cleanly.  To anyone that tries this recipe in the future, please don't worry about over-cooking the milk.  Cook it until it is dark & thick!!  That's the real secret here!  :)  I'll look forward to trying these again.  Thanks for posting, Gailann!

My son is going on the road with his basketball team so I wanted to make these for him to take for them all..

I wanted them to have at least 2 each for there long trip, 19 hours on a bus never fun.. The shortbread recipe is wonderful and works so well, my son was very impressed that I had made that from scratch.. I failed to tell him how easy it was.. :) I used 3 cans of condensed milk and used the microwave method, had to up the time obviously because of the extra but it worked a treat.. I then used a mixture of semi sweet and milk chocolate for the top.. I put the final product in the fridge to half firm up and then like a previous reviewer had suggested I scored through the chocolate part, placed it all back in the fridge to set completely and cut once set.. The scoring works great as the chocolate cuts evenly and everything is set so well that the knife glides through the rest with ease.. Will have to let you know what the team thought tomorrow as that is when they hit the road. As far as our family goes they have been very much enjoyed and we all agree on a super recipe that is worth every bit of the 5 stars and coming from my son who is usually the toughest marker on the stars that really says something.. Thanks for sharing.......... Update: Son was supposed to call from the road but alas NO! only heard from him when he got back in town today, the scamp...

My biggest regret is that I didn't make a double or even quadruple batch.\\nI'm not much of a wing connoisseur - I just eat them when I get a chance; and since I'm an intermediate cook, I don't think I'd ever prepared wings before this. I thought the same thing as in the description: this is more of a method than a recipe; but it's an effective method, I think. I don't think I've ever used my broiler (don't know why I'm leery of using it). It gives me a choice of high and low, and I chose high. I peeked at the wings at 5 minutes, and opted to go the full 10 minutes on each side. Aside from that, I made it exactly as written. I agree that the boiling and then the broiling get rid of a lot of fat. (I, too, used parchment paper in the oven, on top of a jelly-roll pan). I patted the wings with paper towels to remove any excess grease, as suggested, and there was very little left to remove. The wings were beautifully browned and crispy. One minor complaint is that the amount of barbecue sauce was a little too much, I thought - 1/3 cup would probably be plenty. Oh, and this really should be called Simple Boil and Broil [not Bake] Crispy Chicken Wings.

For the salt I used table salt, cuz I was out of kosher & it was fine using half.  I also never heard of garlic flakes, so I used about 4 T of garlic powder.

This is the second recipe going into our Best of 2012 cookbook.  I love everything bagels and rolls, so this recipe seemed like a no-brainer.  I am SO glad we tried it.  I had one chicken breast half that I sliced lengthwise and laterally, to approximate the size of 4 large tenders, and I used a homemade house seasoning mix that contains only the salt, pepper and garlic flakes instead of those three in the recipe.   The olive oil is a nice change from dredging in eggs, milk or mayo, and the seeds and spices stuck right to it.  The chicken did not dry out at all in the oven, and didn't need the dipping sauce, but I couldn't stop dipping anyway!  This was a quick and easy recipe for a busy weeknight.

I checked a few other yemista recipes, and none of them said to cover the baking dish, so I duly popped it in the oven. After 2 hours the rice was still hard, but the veggies were cooked.

I make this often using a variety of different vegetables when we are looking for something vegetarian. I have used zucchini, orange bell peppers are our favorite, plum tomatoes, onions.

I use Basmati rice, a good extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, plus the rest of ingredients. I sea salt the vegetables before and after stuffing. I have never added the potatoes as we have started to avoid them for allergy reasons. I cover the pan the whole time as tightly as I can with aluminum foil. I never use bread as we are gluten & yeast free. I sometimes add a bit of homemade chicken stock with the water in the pan, but water works fine on its own.
