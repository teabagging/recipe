Others we have tried were lacking in spices, they just needed something extra.  This one has a good spice mix, and we like the addition of the dried cherries and the pistachios.  We used our meat grinding attachment for the first time and felt the flavor of the meats was better as we knew exactly what went into it, instead of buying ground meats to use which can be made from several different cuts of meat.  I used boneless country rib meat for the pork, and chicken thigh meat instead of duck, which is not easy to find here.  I also used twice as much chicken liver as the recipe calls for as you want to be able to taste it over the spices.  About the spices, the recipe lists a total of 4 tablespoons of spices, yet after they are mixed and set aside it only ever tells you to add 3/4 of a teaspoon of the mix!  We knew that this was not near enough spices from previous attempts, so added half of the mix (2 tablespoons) instead.  This was better than other pates we had made as to spices but it still needed more.  Next time I make this I will add the entire 4 tablespoons of the spice mix to the meat.  We have been enjoying this pate with grainy mustard, ground horseradish, and cornichons and froze about 2/3 of it in smaller packages to use over the next few months.

Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil and pour over the brine ingredients; whisk to dissolve. Pour in 1 gallon fresh cold water to cool down the mixture. Score the skin side of the pork roast with a sharp knife. Cut into the fat beneath the skin but not into the meat. Score about 1 inch apart, then score in the opposite direction to get the classic diamond-shaped pattern. Lower scored roast into the cooled brine, skin side up. Use a plate to weigh down the roast so that it cures fully submerged in the liquid. Refrigerate for 1 day for every 2 pounds of pork (for a 7 pound roast, cure for at least 2 1/2 days). Turn the roast over halfway through the brining process. Remove roast from brining liquid. Discard the brining liquid and transfer the roast back to the brining container. Cover the roast with fresh cold water to rinse off some of the salt. Depending on how salty you want your ham, you can soak it for just a few minutes or overnight. Remove roast from the water and blot dry with paper towels. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Add a cup of water to a roasting pan with 2 whole star anise. Place roast on a rack in the roasting pan. Roast until ham reaches an internal temperature of 130 to 135 degrees F, about 2 hours. Ham will not be fully cooked at this point. If water has nearly evaporated, add a splash more. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Continue to roast until skin is browned and crispy and ham reaches an internal temperature of 145 to 150 degrees F.
