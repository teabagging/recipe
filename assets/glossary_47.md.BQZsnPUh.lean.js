It was so sticky and it wouldn't stretch well, and our stromboli did NOT come out looking nice.  So this weekend we looked around and found a pizza dough recipe of Emeril's that he had used in a stromboli (recipe #84545).  We made that dough, divided it and rolled out into two 10x14 rectangles, filled each rectangle with the toppings, and rolled into 2 large logs,  brushing the edges with egg wash to keep it closed and the top with egg wash.  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes, then added toppings from this recipe, and baked another 5 minutes.  It was excellent.  Cut into slices and serve with warmed pizza sauce for dipping, if desired.  This could easily be served at a party as an appetizer.

This recipe was WAY to salty. I kind of spotted this out when i was mixing the sauce so i made sure to use light soy sauce. It turned out WAY WAY to salty.  Also a bit to much fish sauce for my taste (yes i like fish sauce and i use it with my thai cooking). Maybe some people will like the fish sauce part but its to salty for anyone.

I had to stick with canned, but when the opportunity arises, I will definitely use 'real' tuna -- seared tuna is something I almost always order when I encounter it in a good restaurant, and it's hard to believe that comes from basically the same animal! I made the tuna salad part and the tomato vinaigrette part a day ahead. I used all scallions and omitted the red onion in the tuna and I made up a balsamic vinaigrette because that's what I had around. Oh! And I did use the anchovy -- I used an anchovy paste so that I would have a more storage stable product, and next time I will probably use a bit more. I don't think I could taste anything specifically, but with all the other ingredients, this was a very elevated way to have tuna. I am not rating with stars because I ended up substantially changing the presentation. I made a thin pizza crust which I prebaked with olive oil and salt and onion powder. Then I added fresh spinach leaves, the tuna, and some grated parm and let that bake for a little while. Then I distributed the tomato vinaigrette over that and turned on the broiler for 2 minutes. A high-end tuna melt? I was told it was very good, and that's all that counts. I will definitely make this again, and am really looking forward to it with 'real' tuna and plated as written.

First, this quiche had exceptional flavor- one of the best tasting quiches I have ever made. My reservation with this recipe is the texture. No matter how long I baked this I couldn't get it to set properly. I notice from other reviews that other cooks had a similar problem with the cooking time.I also notice that the recipe called for   twice the liquid than most quiches. Maybe that was the problem or maybe a typo? I am fairly certain that I squeezed all of the water out of the cooked spinach as was possible but I'm sure that water from the spinach contributed to the problem of too much liquid somewhat. I think this is a wonderful recipe and I will try it again because it is one well worth trying to tweak. I think I will reduce the milk to one cup and be sure the spinach is pressed very dry and cook at 350.

I used half coffee and half water. This has too strong of a cocoa flavor for me- it tastes a little too much like eating straight cocoa powder, and I did add more sugar than called for to try and compensate for this. Maybe I will try adding some more vanilla or something. I just added a spoonful to my coffee to make a cafe mocha for myself, which worked pretty well (still a little bitter). I was hoping for sort of a Hershey's syrup substitute (since I know that is fat-free, too), but this falls a little short. The texture is kind of funny, kind of like pudding, but if I hadn't added that extra tsp cornstarch, it would just be liquid. I will try and tinker with this and make it more palatable, but I would not make this again. \\n7/28/04 - Sorry, but I decided that I really had to re-review this.  I found that I could not save the flavors of this sauce, no matter what I added.  But also upon refrigerating, it seperated- so there was liquid and a lump of cornstarchy solid stuff.  I ended up just throwing it out.

As written, I think it would be a good sauce for ice cream.  I think previous reviewers may have been looking for something more like pudding.  Even Hershey's chocolate sauce is not thick and sweet!
