I only had 45 minutes to marinade them, I put them on the grill, and DANG...they were so moist, so soft, and the taste was amazing!  Thought all that lemon pepper would over power it but it was perfect!  Thought the soy sauce  would over salt it, but that, too, was perfect.  My hubby said I am to add this to my arsenal of food made often.  Thank you so much for making my first pork chops ever a delight and so easy!"},{"name":"homestyle pot roast for the crock pot","steps":"in a nonstick skillet , heat oil over medium high heat', 'pat roast dry with paper towel and brown in skillet on all sides', 'transfer to slow cooker', 'reduce heat to medium', 'add onions and celery and cook , stirring until softened', 'add garlic , thyme , salt and pepper and cook , stirring for one minute', 'add flour and cook , stirring for 1 more minute', 'add beef broth and bay leaf and cook , stirring until thickened', 'pour mixture over roast', 'cover and cook on low for 10-12 hours or on high for 5-6 hours , until meat is tender', 'stir green peppers and steak sauce into gravy', 'cover and cook on high for 30 minutes until peppers are soft', 'to serve , discard bay leaf , place roast on platter and spoon sauce over', 'enjoy !'","description":"this recipe sounds great!  what's not to love :)","ingredients":"vegetable oil', 'beef roast', 'onions', 'celery', 'garlic cloves', 'dried thyme leaves', 'salt', 'black peppercorns', 'flour', 'condensed beef broth', 'bay leaf', 'green pepper', 'steak sauce'","review":"SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!!

LOL)...so I substituted with garlic powder.  And THATS why this recipe gets 5 stars...it was STILL delicious!!

Since grilling season started we've eaten a lot of chicken and beef, and I wanted something different. I don't normally like grilled pork chops because they are often tough and dry. With so many reviews saying these were moist and tender I figured all of you must be right, and boy were you! The other nice thing is this is a marinade you can make substitutions to and it still tastes great. I only had regular soy sauce and thought I had lemon pepper seasoning, but it was garlic pepper, so I added a squeeze of lime juice. I also only had garlic powder and 1 hour to marinate. None of this seemed to matter...even picky BF kept raving about the taste and he was very skeptical when he saw me making it. Also, the cooking times for different thicknesses are a real help. My bone-in loin chops we're about 3/4 to 1&quot; and 6 minutes per side made them perfectly moist and tender. Iserved them with rice-a-roni and fried corn.

For my batch, I used several types of basil from our fall garden explosion, giving the end product a pretty green and purple dotted color. Spinach makes this pesto a bit less intense than some others, but seems to make the basil taste and smell even fresher. Cashews bump up the nutty flavor and texture, and I now like them more than pine nuts. I did make some minor changes. I added 1/4 cup of green olives, because I had a feeling that another layer of salty/sweet would work, and it did. I was out of white wine (argh!), so I substituted Sanpellegrino Limonata (Italian Lemon Soda). Next time I will make sure there is wine in the house before I start, but the Limonata did not hurt it a bit. In fact, it is probably a good non-alcoholic option.

Peeled and cubed the potatoes before boiling, which saved a fair amount of time. While the potatoes boiled, I prepared the other ingredients and then it took just a few minutes to saute the onions, etc. in the pan. I ended up adding more sea salt and cayenne, and only used 1/3 of the suggested fennel, as I didn't want it to dominate the flavours. \\n\\nThe pastry dough was quick, easy and a pleasure to work with. I rolled it out into circles, split at the equator and just put the filling on one half of the half circle, and pressed the other half on top of it, pinching and folding over the sides. Found this easier than shaping it into a cone and filling, and it worked out very well. We're out of peanut oil and ghee at the moment, but I wanted to use a traditional, heat-stable fat so I used some organic, pasture-fed lard and it worked beautifully. Didn't impart any off tastes to the samosas. For a vegetarian oil option, coconut oil would be a good choice.\\n\\nQuick, easy, beautifully flavoured recipe, and it really sated my craving for samosas--thanks for posting!"},{"name":"honey citrus carrots","steps":"cook the carrots in apprx 1 of water for 10 minutes , they should still be slightly crisp so the time depends on the size / thickness of the carrots', 'drain', 'while the carrots are cooking , mix together the melted butter , honey & grated citrus peel', 'pour over the drained carrots and warm the carrots through over low heat until the carrots are glazed', 'sprinkle with chopped parsley'","description":"easy recipe to dress up carrots","ingredients":"carrots', 'butter', 'honey', 'lemon, rind of', 'orange rind', 'parsley'","review":"Instead of making the pastry I used samosa wrappers (found in the frozen foods section at Indian/Pakistani grocery stores) I'm just rating the filling part of the recipe.

Cut down the fennel as per other reviewers' suggestion and pan fried instead of deep fried.  Put them in the oven for 15 minutes to brown them a little more. It took me quite a while (3 hours) but I attribute that to not really knowing what I was doing.  The two issues I had that slowed me down were that once I had made the little cones, it was a little hard to get the filling inside, and then secondly, it was a little tricky to seal them up.  A little squishing did the trick.  Long project, but would have gone faster with someone else's help.

Actually, it was nice to see both grilled up fine following your directions and were great substitutes in the dish.  DH said that with the veggies being in the foil packets, the dish was missing out on that nice grilled smokey flavor you would otherwise get.  He suggests not chopping the veggies ahead of time and cooking them separately and whole on the grill versus putting them in foil packets, then chopping them after grilling so that smokey flavor is imparted.

I was looking for a stress free killer desert for the holidays. On top of that we are both diabetic so I wanted something that I could get as low carb as possible.

I substituted the sugar for Splenda and added a teaspoon of coconut extract to make sure that the pie had enough flavor as one of the reviews that I read some where said that the pie was eggy and did not have a lot of flavor.  That surely was not my experience.  I did make a few mistakes.  I almost forgot to add the butter and had to add it in to the pie after it was in the pie pan and I started the pie on the middle rack.  After 45 minutes of cooking the pie was not even close to being done so I moved it down to the bottom rack and cooked it for another 10 minutes.   It browned and was done in this amount of time.  I was afraid that with the Splenda that it would not brown but it did.  We had the pie for desert that night and my husband ate 3/4 of the pie by himself and stated that it was holiday approved.   Thank you for posting this and making my hubby a very happy man.  Just a note for anyone else that needs to be concerned about sugar, I will buy unsweetened coconut and steep it a Splenda simple sugar like solution to further reduce the added sugar.

I only used two potato's, one thin layer at the bottom, and one on top. And I only had half of a large onion available, so I diced it and used it for the middle layer. I also drizzled much more butter than recommended, four times as much total, a couple tbsp on each layer. Also several seasonings were added, parsley, sage, etc. Also a little bit of cheese was added in between the layers. I also topped the whole dish with parmesan and more cooking oil/spray while it was in the oven. It's passed the first 20 minutes covered, and is now finishing it's 40 minutes uncovered. I sliced the potatoes very thin, and only did layered them thinly... so I expect the cooking time to be less. But we'll see. i also added a generous amount of Louisiana hot sauce on each layer. I'll post this after the dish is ready and has been tasted so I can add a final review at the end...<br/><br/>This dish turned out great.

This recipe is the one that I will always make! I was thrilled to find a recipe with whole grain flour and pure honey for the sweetener. I often use half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour for cookies because using all whole wheat flour usually makes them too dense. However, using 100% whole wheat flour for this recipe makes a wonderful graham cracker texture. For extra flavor, I stirred in one teaspoon of vanilla extract into the butter and honey mixture. Instead of greasing the baking sheet, I cut a piece of parchment paper a couple inches larger than my 17 by 11 inch baking sheet. On the ungreased parchment paper, I rolled the dough into an 1/8 inch thick, 16 x 10-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter, I cut twenty 4&quot; by 2&quot; rectangles by first slicing the dough into four 16-inch-long-strips; then, slicing across the strips to make four 4-inch-long-rectangles. Leaving the precut dough intact on the parchment paper, I placed the whole thing on my baking sheet and baked for ten minutes. Next, I transferred the parchment paper with baked dough to a wire rack. After cooling for two minutes, I gently pulled the rectangular crackers apart along the precut lines. They perfectly tore along the precut lines like a perforated stamp. Since the dough was still soft and pliable after being cooked, I thought it may need to be baked for longer. However, once the individual Whole Wheat Graham Cracker Cookies were fully cooled on the wire racks, they became crisp. My favorite way of eating graham crackers is dipping them in a tall glass of cold milk until they become almost soggy and then nibbling on them. Plus, they make the milk taste sweet like cinnamon and honey.

When you want to pound the breasts, cover you counters with a layer of plastic wrap, lay the breasts on the plastic warp, then lay another layer on top of this. This stops splattering raw juices around the kitchen, and makes cleanup easier. Note that you still MUST clean and sanitize the countertop after the dish is made. I use a bread stuffing in place of the rice stopping (really, what you want is two different stuffings), and I don't use a baking bag-I tent it in aluminum foil. The bags are expensive and sometimes hard to find, I always have aluminum foil around, and it's cheap. If the bacon does not look done, when the cooking is finished, remove from the bag or foil, and place under the broiler (NOT too close) for a couple of minutes to finish the bacon. Finally, the resting before carving is vital, as is making sure the temperature, taken in several places, is over 165&deg;F (74&deg;C) for reasons of food safety. Note that some turducken roulade recipes use 3 stuffings, but I find that the amount you could place inside the chicken breast is so small, it's not worth the effort making a third type of stuffing."},{"name":"honey walnut berry yogurt","steps":"put your yogurt into a bowl , you could use greek yogurt or strain the regular-type yogurt in cheese cloth or coffee filters the night before', 'add your nuts and berries', 'squeeze the honey over the top to taste', 'i like the kind in the honey bear for this to make it fast and easy for morning !'","description":"trying to be more heart healthy, i am trying to throw in a handful of raw walnuts a day.  i thought i would flavor them up a bit so here's a nice and easy breakfast that i came up with!!!  you can use any berries you want, i like blackberries!","ingredients":"plain yogurt', 'berries', 'walnuts', 'honey'","review":"this was ok. i couldnt stomach the thought of mayonnaise in my jello so i made a different dressing. the jello wasnt very sweet and the cranberries added an odd texture that we didnt care foe. i added bananas and shredded apple since i cant eat grapes or pinapple. i loved the bananas in it and also i used walnuts. mm. it was interesting but not my favorite.\\nthanks."},{"name":"honey walnut bread","steps":"crumble the yeast and dissolve it in one cup of the water', make sure the water's got the right temperature , as the bread won't rise if the water's too cold and the yeast will be killed if too hot, 'once completely dissolved , add the remaining water , honey , oil , salt and walnuts , and continue to mix', 'i usually use a stand mixer when making this bread , as the dough is pretty big and the recipe calls for a lot of kneading', 'let the mixer go , and while mixing , add 4 cups of flour , one cup of whole wheat flour , the rye flour and rolled oats', 'add more flour until the dough lets go off the bowl , but be careful not to add to much', 'the dough should be really sticky ! continue to mix on medium speed for about 10 minutes , cover the dough with a towel and let rise until doubled in size', 'punch the dough down , and let rest for an additional 10 minutes', 'preheat oven to 420 degrees f and oil four bread pans', 'when the dough is done proofing , turn it onto a lightly floured surface and knead , knead knead ! add more flour if necessary', 'cut the dough in four equal pieces and place in prepared pans', 'cover with a towel and let rise for 30-60 minutes', 'bake in oven for twenty minutes , and let cool completely before removing bread from pan'","description":"this honey walnut bread is so good my father eats a whole loaf by himself!","ingredients":"fresh yeast', 'water', 'vegetable oil', 'honey', 'salt', 'walnuts', 'all-purpose flour', 'whole wheat flour', 'rye flour', 'rolled oats'","review":"I didn't completely follow the directions, but the soup was fantastic.

I'm not sure I will ever make the traditional meat and tomato sauce lasagne again after this one.  We love mushrooms so I used two 8 oz. packages and increased the butter just a bit to saute them.  This is a rich dish; however, this is not an everyday dish -- so when you do make it -- it will be a real treat.  Love the fact that I have plenty of leftovers to eat this week. Can't wait to make this dish for Company.  Made for the 1-2-3 Tag, December, 2011."},{"name":"honey cumin beef kebabs","steps":"slice meat into 1 / 4 thick strips', 'combine all other ingredients', 'pour over meat and marinate at least 3 hours in refrigerator', 'skewer meat by threading onto long bamboo skewers that have been soaked in water for 20 minutes', 'heat broiler', 'place skewers on broiler pan and broil 3-5 minutes , basting with marinade', 'serve hot'","description":"i clipped this from a magazine many moons ago. these are very good.","ingredients":"london broil beef', 'olive oil', 'vinegar', 'honey', 'ground cumin', 'paprika', 'scallion', 'salt'","review":"This was a great lasagna, even my 3 year old enjoyed it. I used a little more flour since I thought the sauce needed to be thicker and I added some fresh nutmeg which gave it a nice flavor. Next time I might use fresh thyme instead.

The combination of ingredients was fantastic and I could have had more. The only change I made was to use butter as I don't like margarine, so it's not quite as healthy but is it ever good!
