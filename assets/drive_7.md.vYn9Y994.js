I believe I can answer multiple questions at once. My main charcoal grill is down in SEMO. Up near Chicago house sitting for 2 weeks, working w a propane grill.   The \\"guestimate\\" time of 10 min is irrelevant. Like the author said, depends on the grill, heat and conditions. Be a better griller. Watch for the juices to start flowing. 6 minutes on the first side and 4 on the other was absolutely perfect for me. As far as the lid situation goes, I had to alternate between open/closed when the fat starts up in order to sear but not charcoal.  After searing, moved over to inderect heat and applied my own bbq sauce for 5 min per side.  When you take it off the grill...wrap it in foil for 5 minutes. Trust me.

Thank you for posting it, I have been seeking a simple and delicious pad thai recipe and this fit the bill!  The only thing I would say is the method for preparing the rice noodles should be changed.  After much research I found that the preferred method is to pour boiling water over the noodles and soak for about 5 minutes until soft, then rise with cold water, and rinse again with cold water.   I did mine this way and the texture of the noodles was perfect, and this was the first time I made pad thai.    The rest is like any recipe, this is a great start but tailor to your taste. I stir fried using a touch of veg oil, and some sesame oil, adding a couple of cloves of minced garlic as well.  I have a non stick electric wok so little oil is necessary, making the dish healthier.  I mixed rice vinegar, fish sauce, oyster sauce and sirachi with chicken broth in a bowl.  This allowed me test the flavor, and pour it over the noodles while stir frying.    Thanks again.  I love pad thai and now I can make it at home!'"},{"name":"Melt In Your Mouth Pork Chops","rate":"3.912499905","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/720x405/2801751.jpg","ingredients":"soy sauce teriyaki sauce water pork chops","cooking":" Prep 20 m Cook 1 h 20 m Ready In 1 h 40 m In a large bowl combine soy sauce, teriyaki sauce and water.
