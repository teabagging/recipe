Therefore, if you plan to make the 6-layer Chocolate Motherlode Cake that goes with this frosting recipe, you'll need to triple the ingredients to make enough frosting the cover the entire cake!  That being said, the frosting is delicious.  It took me a little longer than 15 minutes to do the prep work (finely chopping the chocolate).  It could be that I'm just slower than other people though... :)  This frosting has a nice velvety texture when done right.  It will take a while for it to cool and turn into a frosting consistency (I'm not sure how long, but I will try to time it the next time I make this recipe).  If you put it in the fridge to chill, watch it like a hawk.  If the frosting gets too cold, it will harden like a candy bar!  It's still tasty that way, but I prefer the frosting with a smooth texture that comes with leaving it at room temperature with occasional stirring.  Patience is well worth the wait!  I recommend making your cake and frosting it a day before you plan to serve it, and then letting it sit out at room temperature for an hour or two before serving (to allow the chocolate chips and frosting to soften).  The recipe has a five-star taste, but I gave it a rating of four stars for the time involved... if you're willing to give this recipe the time and patience it needs, don't pass it up!  It is truly tasty!"},{"name":"italian grilled shrimp scampi","steps":"split each shrimp on underside down to tail , try to avoid cutting meat', 'put shrimp in bowl with remaining ingredients', 'stir well to coat', 'cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours', 'push onto skewers and grill shrimp 6 inches from heat over a low charcoal fire', 'turn frequently', 'takes about 15 minutes', 'serve skewered shrimp scampi with garlic butter'","description":"","ingredients":"jumbo shrimp', 'olive oil', 'garlic', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'limes, juice of', 'garlic butter'","review":"This frosting is fantastic and complements the Motherlode cake recipe wonderfully!!

I chose to make it because I love apricots, yoghurt and cakes and the idea of a crumb layer within the cake appealed to me. I used a 9 1/2 inch springform, baked for 75 minutes at 350F (no hole in it, therefore a longer cooking time) and since this is a RSC entry otherwise followed the recipe exactly, even had a cup of tea with it. I used apricot brandy and lemon juice and let the cake rest 1 day. It was rich, moist and had a lot of flavour, but that was predominantly that of alcohol to my taste buds. Eating the cake it left a distinct burning sensation on my tongue as strong liquer tends to do. I never before made a cake with more than 2 tbs alcohol in it, so it is probably my fault in misjudging the impact on the flavour.
