I made some big tweaks to the recipe here as My inclination was to layer flavor more deeply.  I used mostly boneless chicken breast (a full pack), a few drumsticks and 1 thigh.  I marinaded the chicken twice.  Before starting with the recipe instructions I marinated first in the juice of 1 home-grown lemon, salt, cumin, coriander, asferitida, pepper and garlic powder.  That sat for about an hour or 2.  Then I did the garlic/ginger paste marinade in a bag for about 4 hours adding more cumin, coriander, pepper, salt.  I used store bought garlic and ginger pastes. To the yoghurt (half a container of lebne style and a scoop of Greek ). I prepped the yogurt mixture in the morning to use for dinner. I added the recommended but kept adding everything to taste as I went. I went most heavy with cumin and garlic powder as I also made the suggested \\"jeera rice\\" to go with. I also went ahead and added some coconut to the Yougurt. I added more coconut when I added the mint leaf/coriander \\"pesto\\" mixture I made. Due to counter space and time, I created that pesto in my nutribullet and added a small scoop of the yogurt mixture and some smoked extra virgin olive oil.   This time I went sans the heavy cream to keep it lighter. Will try with it down the line for sure.
