As far as the pudding amounts, I too (as previous reviewers stated) couldn't find the 153g serving size of vanilla instant pudding.  So, I used one normal size vanilla pudding and then one SF butterscotch instant pudding to make almost 153g's.  I probably shouldn't have used the butterscotch flavored pudding as it seemed to dominate over the vanilla.  It tasted just alright w/the flavor combination of blueberries.  I did find that my topping amount was not enough for a 9x13 size and so future reviewers might want to take this into consideration.  An 8oz cool-whip would probably work perfectly.

I can't believe I made gumdrops! This is a really fun recipe. I used an 8 square pan. I let them dry for about 9 hours, and then rolled them in sugar. The trick to getting them off the cookie sheet is to use a knife, and dip it and your fingers in warm water. These don't end up being as dense as gumdrops you'd buy at the store. They have a more jellylike consistency, but they hold up just fine. I might try adding less applesauce next time I make it to see if that would make them more like store bought. I used strawberry store brand jello (not sugar free), and the flavor is really nice. I made these as a belated birthday present for my stepdad, so I hope he likes them!

These work really well for dropping large Michican blueberries into them on the griddle, because their fluffiness keeps the blueberries encased in batter, rather than sticking all over when you flip the pancakes.  The beaten egg whites are a great way to lighten up the texture!  I did find that it is necessary to spread the batter out a little bit when dropping on the griddle, or they are gooey in the middle, but not too much, or you knock the air out of the egg whites.

I would suggest a few modifications. Like another reviewer I added a bit over 1 tbs brown sugar to the pancake batter which I felt it needed. There is no salt in this recipe and I think that would add a good deal more taste. When I see butter I use unsalted as I believe professionals do especially in sweet dishes. I made ours gluten free using a little over a cup of white rice flour and tapioca starch mixed (starch in half the amount) plus 1 tsp guar gum and bit over 1/2 tsp baking soda (it didn't bubble a lot so it may not have been enough, the texture was fine though) For the butter milk I used very thinned down plain yogurt as that is what I had on hand but I did reduce it somewhat. I think the apple I used was Empire. For the spiced butter I used recipe#184985 as that is what I had on hand, plus the rest of the ingredients except the optional berries (didn't have any) so I topped it with raw, local organic honey which made it nice and sweet. Maybe if it had salt it wouldn't need any sweetener so at the least I suggest useing only salted butter or adding salt to your sweet butter (unsalted).

I mixed all the ingredients as written, fully expecting it to be dry and crumbly per the intro,  but it just crumbled apart in my hands when I tried to form balls out of it. I ended up adding 1 beaten egg to the mixture so it would be more cohesive, which still left the mixture dry and crumbly, but just moist enough to form the cookies without them falling apart. I'm thinking that either the shortening needed to be melted instead of softened, more than one cup of shortening was needed, or there's a missing ingredient (egg or liquid). Anyhow, it was an easy fix to make it workable, and the baked cookies were really yummy. I really liked how they tasted just like a standard oatmeal cookie, but the texture was completely different, more like a Russian teacake/Mexican wedding cake type cookie. Very tender and crumbly. What makes this recipe even better is that it's versatile, because I think it would make a great topping for a fruit crisp, too (that's actually what I was going to do with it if the added egg didn't make it cohesive enough for the cookies).

When I have taken it to other places, I have received a number comments about how good these brownies are. The first time I made it, I was a little skeptical because (1) the cake mix part doesn't seem like enough dough to cover the pan and have enough remaining for dropping by the spoonful, and (2) when I did drop the remaining batter, it sat on top and looked a little gross. There was plenty of cake mix, though, and when the brownies had finished cooking, the marshmallow mixture had risen to the level of the batter, and the brownies looked good. Make sure you use just enough cooking spray so that the brownies don't stick but not any more because it collects at the ends (or it does for me). The only time these have messed up for me is when I decided to throw in (a lot) more peanut butter chips (because I had them, and who wouldn't like more peanut butter chips?), but they made the marshmallow consistency too heavy, and it didn't rise correctly, leaving the batter on top.

The flavours are fantastic - it's quite mild on the curry front but is certainly not lacking flavour in any way. I made this as stated except for the sultanas which I omitted (personal preference) and I used double cream instead of yogurt because my yogurt had turned and cream was all I had in. My qualms re: direction, etc. were as mentioned before. As directed, there was too much water. In view of this I feel the 10min cook time is inaccurate and 20 minutes is more like it if you want to get the sauce thicker. I simmered this for 5mins covered and, when it was looking far too watery, removed the saucepan cover and simmered for another 15mins. All in all I think the whole recipe would have probably been better suited to a frying pan, in which case the water would have evaporated quicker and the amounts would probably have been fine. When I make this again I will definitely be trying it that way. I can't say enough how much we enjoyed this though. My picky other half usually won't touch curries (despite my best efforts) but we both thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely be having it again. Even with an extended cooking time it is a quick and easy curry to make and is also very healthy. I suspect that you could quite easily use less oil, and I also suspect that this would work very nicely in the crockpot. We will most definitely have this again but I will be doing a lot of tampering with the directions. Don't let that put you off though - this is very good - flavourful, healthy and easy to make!

My own changes were: no mushrooms, because we didn't have, no sultanas, because DH hates, and, I totally forgot the tomato paste!!!! I didn't realize it til later because it seemed something was missing, and I imagine the tomato paste lends a lot to the overall flavor, so we'll try it again soon with that. I still found that even with one onion, that was too predominant a flavor. While I was cooking, DH said that his eyes were burning, this is after the onion had been 'cooking out' for a good 20 minutes. Still, we did enjoy it.
