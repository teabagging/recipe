I goofed a bit on the icing though. I had about 2 cups of strawberries & syrup in total, I put one cup in the cake which I thought would be o.k. but I forgot to measure out just a little less than that for the icing, so it was a little runny. I then ran out of icing sugar before I got it to the right consistency! I had to let it set up some in the fridge and then spread some more on,so I was a little worried. In the end it was fine though,it tasted great and was a nice ending to our meal.

The taste wasn't all bland but it could definitely use a boost. I did corn because once again that's what I had on hand, if you do corn I personally would add something like peas or green beans but I bet with broccoli it would taste amazing just as is.

So yummy!  I made recipe exactly - the only thing is that it doesn&#039;t say how many tortillas in &quot;1 package&quot; - mine had 8, but I only had enough mixture for 6.  My mixture came out very gooey due to the Swiss cheese, so here&#039;s a hint for spreading and rolling - I found if I spread it from the middle down on one half of the tortilla, trying to go right to the edges, that the mixture would squeeze/ooze to the ends of the tortilla - otherwise if you spread it all over, it would squish out the open side.  Ok, now about the taste - I used regular onions, I don&#039;t think sweet would work in this recipe, and if you don&#039;t like Swiss cheese, I would skip this recipe.  The flavors are subtle - it&#039;s a shame that so many people need to have their taste buds burned off in order to appreciate flavor anymore, this is not meant to be zesty, piquant dish - but to each his own.  I loved them as is, but could see adding some bacon or ham to have a &quot;quiche Lorraine&quot; type flavor.  Also, after making them, I was thinking that it might be easier to mix room-temperature cream cheese with the onions and Swiss cheese in a mixer until smooth, then spread that - since you are baking them later, the cheese is going to melt then anyway?

These were a big hit at last night&#039;s party.  I did make some changes:  First I used lavash bread.  If your market sells it, you should use it.  Lavash is a rectangle, so it works better in this type of recipe and it is more flavorful and soft than tortillas.&lt;br/&gt;I also made cheese substitutions.  Although these were made to decrease lactose content,  I really liked them and will use them:  I made one batch by simply substituting shredded colby-jack for swiss.  The other batch was made by cutting the cream cheese in half and using goat cheese.  Both of these versions were hits.&lt;br/&gt;The last change was that I froze them for a few hours rather than chilling in the fridgr.  I also sprinkled a bit of cheese on the top of one batch, to distinguish which ones were filled with the colby.  That was a nice improvement.

I even just dropped my raw meatballs into the simmering sauce without pre-browning, and they still stayed together. You couldn't tell that there was feta in them once they were cooked, but they had a more interesting flavor which probably comes from that. I did not add any salt to my dressing. I subbed millet for the couscous just to have a whole grain (same texture); I cooked it in my rice cooker with the broth and lemon juice and some extra water for the necessary moisture. I sauteed about 5 cloves of garlic in the pan before adding the other sauce ingredients. I got 33 ~1-inch meatballs out of the mix and froze half for the future. We still used almost all of both sauces with just half the meatballs. At the end I sprinkled only a tiny amount of lemon juice over the cukes because I thought there would be enough lemon already in the other sauce. It was a very nice mix of textures, temperatures, and flavors. And it looks intimidating with all the parts, but they are each very easy to make, and much can be made ahead.

The brownies are moist and very, very rich.  The chocolate chips stirred into the batter provide little pockets of happiness for the taste buds.  I didn't refrigerate the brownies (didn't have time), and found that I only had about a cup of walnuts and about a cup of pecans on hand, and therefore, used a mix of both.

So rather than give it no stars, I gave it three, because I actually don't know.\\n\\nI did read the reviews on The Food Network site about people who've made this Outrageous Brownie and while most were complimentary and the brownies were everything and more they were promised to be, others had trouble even though they followed directions (pan size included) exactly.\\n\\nThe biggest negative were a couple comments about this brownie being the crumbly type. They didn't look that way on TV. They looked moist and fudgy. Others complained of little things saying the coffee ingredient was too strong, which was not a big deal for me. I love the way coffee compliments chocolate, and if I didn't, I would just cut back on that portion of the recipe. Others said they were too chocolaty and used bittersweet chocolate instead of the unsweetened in the recipe.\\n\\nI am wanting to make these brownies, but have been unsure. There are a lot of expensive ingredients for the recipe to fail and not come out as expected, but I suppose the only way to know is to jump in and try.\\n\\nStill, I have those negative concerns echoing in my head from the TFN site about these brownies. Although Ina herself claimed it was probably the biggest seller at her store (The Barefoot Contessa) at one time and one of the most requested recipes of all time.\\n\\nI've been looking for a while for the perfect brownie recipe and have tried many that were just OK. But these have that certain something, the butter/chocolate/flour ratio that I think might make them the ultimate brownie.\\n\\nThe biggest pet peeve about brownies I have is the edges bake quicker than the middle, and I always end up de-panning and cutting away an inch or so all the way around so nobody gets a crusty edge. Hate that. Also (lol!), if I'm going to make them, I need to make way in the refrigerator to put the pan in when it's partially cooled from the oven. A half sheet pan takes up a lot of space if your refrigerator is somewhat full. I believe cooling them completely in the refrigerator is an important part of this recipe.\\n\\nAnd before anyone suggests making half the recipe (or even a third), that's not an option for me when baking. I don't think Ina would do it, or she would have posted it on TFN's site explaining it was OK to do so. Baking is a science, and just because the recipe is exactly half, doesn't mean you'll achieve the same full results. Those of you that have done so with success....more power to you.\\n\\nAfter all my concerns, if I do dive in and make these soon, I promise to post here with a TRUE review and hopefully set aside any worries I had.

Converted the measurements for the butter and choc chips into cup measurements (2 cups butter, 2 2/3 cups choc chips plus 2 cups choc chips). I actually only made 1/6th of the recipe because this was a test batch (still in search of the perfect brownie recipe) and still it made about 12 decent sized squares. I know scaling down recipes is not a simple exercise of pro-rating ingredients each time but there was no way I was going to make the full recipe. So here is the scaled down recipe I used: 1/2 cup butter, 2/3 cup choc chips + 1/2 cup choc chips, 1.5 oz unsweetened choc (I used the individually wrapped 1 oz bars so these were easy to measure out), 1 extra large egg or 2 medium eggs, 1/2 tbsp vanilla, 9 tbsp sugar (1/2 cup + 1 tbsp), 5 tbsp flour (1/4 cup + 1 tbsp), 3/4 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 3/4 cups walnuts. If adding the coffee granules (I didn't), then 1/2 tbsp of that. Well, these were yummy and rich, fudgy and decadent but I don't know whether it is significantly better than the many cocoa brownie recipes I have tried or worth the extra effort of melting the butter and chocolate in a double boiler. I will probably stick to my cocoa brownie recipe and just add in some choc chips to the batter before baking (I like how the addition of the non-melted choc chips turned out in this recipe). If I do make these again, I will also probably, as a reviewer suggested, use bittersweet chocolate in place of unsweetened chocolate."},{"name":"mimi s gingerbread men","steps":"cream shortening and sugar till light and fluffy', 'stir in egg , molasses and vinegar', 'beat well', 'add dry ingredients', 'chill thoroughly', 'about 3 hours', 'on lightly floured surface , roll to 1 / 4 thick and cut with cutter', 'place on lightly greased sheet', 'add raisins or currants for eyes , nose , and buttons', 'bake 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes , depending on size of the men', 'cool and remove'","description":"i have made these since i was in high school (a long time ago).  i found the recipe in a magazine, maybe better homes and gardens, and tried them.  they were so good.  they still are.  my family loves gingerbread men.  if you don't roll these too thin and if you don't overbake them, they will be soft and wonderful.  they have good flavor.  one hint on the cutter--choose one that has sort of fat arms and legs and not one with spindly extremities because they will get crispy before the body is done.  i like soft gingies.  another cutter that i use is a teddy bear.  then i call them ginger bears.","ingredients":"shortening', 'sugar', 'egg', 'molasses', 'vinegar', 'flour', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'ginger', 'cinnamon', 'clove'","review":"This is a very good basic recipe, and very tasty.

You'll never try another brownie recipe after making these!  Here are a few tips:  For a dark chocolate lovers, use Ghiradelli Double Dark/60%  or bittersweet chocolate in place of the semi-sweet chocolate.  I often use 1 lb of bittersweet chocolate to melt, and 1 to 1 1/2 packages of dark chocolate chips folded into the batter.  Get out your kitchen scale and weigh your chocolate for best results.  While I love dark chocolate, after making these a dozen times, I've discovered that using a good quality semi-sweet chocolate, as directed, yields a crowd-pleasing result (for those who may not love dark chocolate as much).  They are surprisingly rich with the semi-sweet chocolate, too!<br/><br/>Don't hesitate to melt chocolates and butter in the microwave, checking and stirring every minute (usually takes 3 minutes).<br/><br/>Another helpful tip is to line the pan with parchment paper so that there's a 1-2 overhang.  When the brownies have baked and COMPLETELY cooled, you can then carefully lift the whole batch out of the pan and onto a cutting board.  Refrigerate and cut when cold if you like uniform squares.  Otherwise, these moist brownies will look like brownie heaps.  Another treat is to trim the edges off the batch and store these bits in a ziplock bag in the freezer - perfect for a quick fix or for ice cream toppings!<br/><br/>Enjoy and be sure sure to spring for the good stuff:  fresh butter, fresh walnuts, high-quality chocolate.  A batch might set you back $20, but you'll soon be having people wanting to pay you to make them.
