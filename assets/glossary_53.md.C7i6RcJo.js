But, I learned something I am excited to try. Cooking the flour with the sausage. I have always poured the milk in my pan, leaving a little milk in the bottom of my cup, added a couple tbsp of flour in the leftover milk and mixed that together and then poured that into my pan. I did read a couple of reviews on lumpy or thin gravy. You never want to add a thickener (you could also use corn starch) to a hot liquid. It will never mix right.

I think one could make these substituting other meats and other flavors of cheese for the pork sausage. I bet one could also make these with scrambled eggs, cheese, and cooked meat, and have them for breakfast. When I made these, I used already seasoned pork sausage, (which our family makes) and since our seasoned pork sausage already has garlic, onion, sage, salt & pepper in it, I didn't add the basil or chives. I did add a bit more cheese, (about 3/4 cup) and used 1/2 cup of extra sharp white cheddar, and 1/4 cup sharp cheddar. Next time I may add 1 cup of the cheese. My husband says no matter how much cheese you add, you still can't see or taste it in the sausage rolls. I found these were done baking within 13 minutes, but to be sure they weren't doughy, I turned off my oven, then placed them on the upper rack, and let them sit in the oven for 2 more minutes. After I removed them from the oven, I let them sit for 5 minutes before we ate them. The next time I make these, I'm going to add a few red pepper flakes, but I'll add it when I stir in the cheese. I'm sure my hubby will like them even more made that way. By the way, I found these made 2 servings, rather than 4 servings (2 per each person). One more thing I wanted to add...when I rolled up the crescents, I rolled them up from the short end, (like one would do when making a jelly roll) as the other way did not work too well for me.

Made with flavoursome tomatoes and Evelyns wonderfully flavoursome filling, these stuffed tomatoes are bound to be a hit with whoever you make them for, be they family or dinner guests.  I slightly upped the garlic, but otherwise made these exactly to the recipe, even including the raisins C which I dont generally like C because I knew that mixed in with so many other ingredients they were simply going to add to the flavour.  A true 5+++++ recipe, Evelyn!  And one Ill certainly be making again!"},{"name":"chorizo with dates and bacon","steps":"layout the bacon and par cook in the oven for about 5 minutes', 'do not allow to brown', 'remove and allow to cool', 'slice the sausage into 16 slices about 3 / 8 inch thick', 'near the top of each slice of bacon place a slice of sausage and top with of a date', 'roll the bacon around the sausage and date , secure with a toothpick and cut off any excess bacon', 'place on jellyroll pan and bake at 375 degrees until the bacon is fully cooked , about 10 minutes'","description":"a different mix of ingredients with a great taste.","ingredients":"chorizo sausage', 'dates', 'bacon', 'toothpick'","review":"This quiche received rave reviews from my family!

I put the cheese in on top of the bacon and onions, before adding the egg/yogurt mixture. It came out beautiful, but had just a little too much filling for a 9-inch deep dish crust.

I'm guessing that if I had been able to get all of the ingredients to make this as written, it would have been rated about 12 stars, though!  I live in a very rural area and access to some ingredients is sometimes hard to come by, so I wasn't able to find canned or fresh tomatillos. I still wanted to try the recipe, though, so I used a jar of Pace Salsa Verde in place of the tomatillos.  I just used the whole jar and left out the chicken stock altogether.  I also used a very lean roast and just cooked it whole, without browning it first.  (I was in a hurry!)  The chipotle in this is the vital ingredient, I think. (Yes, I can find chipotle, but no tomatillos!).  I have tried many similar recipes, but this is the closest thing I've found to the chile verde that is served at my favorite Mexican restaurant, and I'm sure it's the smokiness of the chipotles that is what puts this recipe far above any others that I've tried.

This could have been due to trying to split the eggs, or using butter rather than margarine.  I also cut mine thicker and got 24 cookies out of the first roll.  I baked on parchment and they came out soft and delicious!  Nutmeg would also be a good flavoring in place of the cinnamon.  They would be stunning if you iced them.

I made this today and I have only allowed us to share one piece between the 3 of us. I have my family coming down tomorrow and I want it for then.. I will no doubt have to come back and update this review then as I know they will love this. I am also having to stop my son and hubby taking sneaky little slithers from the fridge until then.. lol.. No seriously this is well worth the effort to make it turns out sensational and for me far better than any tart I have bought from the bakers. This is the absolute perfect combination of ingredients FT and this one has gone straight into my favourites. I served ours with fresh whipped cream today, but I have bought some vanilla bean ice cream to serve with it, along with the whipped cream tomorrow. Totally indulgent but totally delicious. This is a winner with a big thumbs up. :) \\nUpdate: My whole family had this today with fresh whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream. Every single one of them said wow. Not to boast but we really are the tart family in the sense that we live in Switzerland so like FT we get some really amazing tarts from our local village bakeries. There were 7 more people that tried this today and they all said how superb it was. The only criticism my mum had was that the apricot glaze over the top would have been better if I had used my mums homemade apricot jam with lavender. I have to agree that would have added a whole different taste to it. But then I am blessed to have a mum that makes some pretty mean preserves. But all my family could not stop going on about the taste of the tart in general and also the fact that using the fresh apricots that were not over ripe, just added to the tart flavour and for us just pushed it over the top. I have gone on now I know, but for those who are put off by all the steps and the labour intensive steps from the pastry to the apricots to the baking of the tart itself. All I can say is that if you love apricots and this kind of thing it will in no way disappoint, FT has come up with the absolute perfect tart recipe."},{"name":"chuck wagon steak rub","steps":"mix all together', 'rub on steaks , chicken , pork , or fish', 'grill , fry , bake , or broil', 'can be stored for up to 5 months in a shaker'","description":"the secret is the coffee!!! this is a variation of a steak rub from a morning news show (dont remember which one), only they made the montreal steak seasoning from scratch....i say forget that...this was a big hit & so much easier!!! too much pepper? add more o. powder and coffee. enjoy!","ingredients":"[mccormick's montreal brand steak seasoning, 'onion powder', 'coffee'","review":"I made this yesterday and it's the best apricot tart I've ever made - it disappeared in 10 minutes between 8 of us... and everyone was looking for seconds...

It was too dry however and each slice broke in half. I don't think mine was as dry as chia's though. Maybe more honey would help? I used creamed honey. Some raisins are drier than others as well but I used Sunmaid which are pretty soft in the larger amount which I added separately to the mill to blend and did not have a problem with the colour like another reviewer. It looks similar to what you can buy in buckets in the store which DH loves but he turned his nose up at this because it was dry looking. I toasted the sesame seeds and whole pistachio nuts in the oven at 350F tossing a couple times. I blended them warm in my spice mill/coffee grinder along with the white sugar which became almost a paste. I have never tried the store bought ones or felt the consistency of them as they contain glucose (corn) which is allergenic to us. This is so much healthier. While shaping the batter into a tiny loaf it did crack somewhat so if I were to try this again and see that, at that point I would add more honey.

(He who swears no one can EVER make better meatloaf or lasagna than his mother)  He even commented a couple of times about how great it was and that he went back for seconds.  I did make some changes but nothing too drastic.  I only had lean ground beef so I used that.  I didn't have enough garlic croutons so I toasted some bread and used that to make up the difference.  Someone used up all my thyme (husband) so i used a mix of marjoram and basil, with an extra shake of basil thrown in (I like basil).  I also added one of those small boxes of frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed very dry).  I put that in the food processor with the garlic and other veggies.  I did not have any bell peppers so I left that out.  Also, in the sauce, I omitted the cumin, put a few shakes of ground ginger in instead (maybe a 1/4 to a 1/2 tsp), and added several dashes more of the hot sauce and worchestershire because I couldn't taste it in the mix.  I baked mine at 350 for 30 minutes, then brushed the sauce on, then I baked it for another 50 minutes and it came out measuring 180 degrees.  I probably could have bumped the heat down, or something for the last round of baking.  Still it didn't seem overcooked.
