Once tender, stir in the chorizo pieces, and cook until hot. Combine with the penne pasta and Parmesan cream sauce to serve","reviews":"This a a really great recipe.  I used spicy chorizo that we got from our CSA share and used a stove-top grill pan as it is freezing here!   I cut back on the butter (using only 1 stick), and I added more cracked red pepper.   It was rich without being too greasy.  I think 1 cup of butter would be too much.  Also, I think whole or low fat milk would work fine instead of heavy cream, but I did use HC this time.  It was very yummy and there were lots of left overs.

I made the harissa sauce from chef Johns recipe on this site.  I like it spicy so I left the seeds in the habanero when making the harissa.  Make this recipe exactly as is but keep in mind that the longer you marinade the chicken the more flavorful it will be.  Between 3-8 hours if you have the patience to wait that long.  Also,  Cut the final cooking time down by 5 minutes or the chicken will come out on the dry side and the veggies will be overdone.  At least that was my experience.  Making the harissa is a little tedious but sooooo worth it!  One of my favorite sauces and can be put on anything.'"},{"name":"Scott's Coast-to-Coast Famous Chicken Wings","rate":"4.599999905","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/720x405/2019591.jpg","ingredients":"gallon peanut oil chicken wings unsalted butter hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®) garlic powder coarse-ground black pepper","cooking":" Prep 30 m Cook 15 m Ready In 45 m Heat oil in a deep-fryer or kettle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
