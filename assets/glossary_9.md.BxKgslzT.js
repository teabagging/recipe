I lived and worked a lot in the South, and these came out better than lot of them I've had there! The tips worked....especially keep the butter ice cold, use a food processor to cut, fold the buttermilk in by hand, keep the dough super wet and messy, and barely work the dough, no rolling, only patting. The less you touch it, the fluffier the biscuit. I only kneaded it 3 times by folding in 3, using a pastry cutter to lift the dough.

Anyway, I was concerned about measurements because several of my measuring spoons are MIA but I must have gotten close. I used a small food processor and put the dry and butter mix back in the freezer for a bit. I think I added a bit too much buttermilk because the dough was a bit sticky when I went to pat it out. I was really worried that they would be too crumbly since good biscuits have a reputation for being finicky.

I'd never tried biscuits before, as being from Australia, they are not a common thing. We do have the similar but sweet British scones, which are served with jam and cream. I used the food processor like the author, and found it to be easy. I did find the wet dough hard to work with as it kept sticking to my hands. I'd be grateful for any tips on this. I was also not sure if you are supposed to flatten the dough again between each fold. Like another reviewer stated, the ones I pieced together from the leftover dough turned out better than the first ones, which makes me think that a little kneading may be ok. I may have flattened the dough a little too much before cutting because mine weren't super tall. This may have partly been due to the cutter I used which was a Tupperware double sided one, where it has two different sized circles on each side. I used the bigger side, but it probably pressed the cut rounds down too much. I know an old trick with scones is to actually use a small drinking glass to cut the rounds and keep them nice and high. Mine cooked a little too fast, which I was prepared for as my oven runs hot. The taste was buttery and savoury, which was strange being used to sweet scones, but not unpleasant.

This recipe made me think!  This recipe is all about the SAUSAGE, so make sure you have mighty fine sausage.  Chicago is the meat-packing capital of the world, so there you can probably find wonderful sausage almost anywhere.  I used Johnsonville Sweet Italian, which is about the best sausage we get in the greater Baltimore area, UNLESS YOU MAKE THE SAUSAGE YOURSELF.  This recipe almost requires that you make your own sausage.  In the past year, I have been disappointed with most commercial sausage I have tried -- too much gristle! Not enough flavor!  I found myself dreaming of Wild Boar sausage from DH&#039;s past hunting expeditions. The pie crust is not as odd as one might think. Chicago pizza dough DOES NOT CONTAIN CORNMEAL and it does rely heavily on CORN OIL; it is usually THICK, almost like a biscuit base, but tasting more like pastry pie crust in its flakiness. The thin pie crust allowed me to add all of the ingredients for this recipe, but my pie didn&#039;t firm up for a decent slice until 30 minutes after I removed it from the oven.  I believe that a thicker crust would have sped up that process.  As for pizza sauce, I made my own using Recipe #413005 reduced to pizza sauce thickness and jazzed up as I saw fit.  It worked fine.  Back to the NY pizza bias: normally I would ask for &quot;extra sauce&quot;, but in this recipe, that would be ridiculous!  In the end, I applaud your effort, you made me think outside my box.

I also grated a little white chocolate over the cocoa poweder on top.

The real secret is letting it sit overnight to really let the flavors mix. I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan with a double layer and I used a starbucks liquer instead of the Tia Maria (which was a bit too expensive for such a small amount used) and used some starbucks espresso shots to keep the flavors similar. I also took the advice of one reviewer and added just a touch more sugar (about a quarter cup in total) and I can say that it got rave reviews from my entire Taiko group. It was very light and airy, and was a very nice change from some more heavy desserts that sit in your stomach like a stone. Because I was using soft ladyfingers, I found it was much easier to brush and pour the espresso/liquer onto them instead of dipping them (they tended to fall apart).

When I first made this I was disappointed. I knew the texture of the cream was perfect, but it needed improvement. So I made it again. As others have mentioned, definetely, more sugar 1/3 cup and even 1/2 cup is not bad. Don't think that is just the opinion of someone w/a sweettooth, the strong coffee overpowers the sugar. Also, in my first attempt, because I had never made tiramisu, I didn't know how absorbent ladyfingers are. When you dip them, it should be just in and out very quickly, a fraction of a second on each side. The first one had too much liquid. You shouldn't have to drain them, if you had so much liquid that it began to drip, you'd find that they will become very fragile and may break apart in your hands and in turn it will be mushy. Once I did that I was very very pleased.

Quite the perfect tiramisu, thanks Syrah.

This was much sweeter than what I was expecting, like one I get from a restaurant that I go to, but the sugar amount is great in this one too. I had a couple problems, but just from lack of experience, I think. I have figured out most of what I could do better, but I'm still not quite sure how to get the lady fingers just right. When I got the outsides perfect the insides were too hard and when the insides were perfects the outer parts were soggy. Maybe just practice? Still, this had awesome flavor, easy to follow directions, and made me and my dad very happy.

My SIL likes to rate meals using a rating of fail, satisfactory and outstanding - he gave the entire meal an outstanding + due mostly to this recipe.  I must say that I have never tasted a tiramisu I cared for, both due to texture and flavor, the flavor in this was amazing, the only part of it I didn&#039;t care for was the texture - I&#039;ve got to find a way to put some crunch in there in the future.

So, I decided to try this recipe.  I doubled it because I was bringing it to a pot luck and because I bought the large tub of marscapone.  I also didn&#039;t know what caster sugar was, but going on one of the reviews, I used powdered sugar - and it worked fine.  I also only made the 2 cups of coffee, but I used about 1/4 cup.  I can&#039;t imagine using so much liquid in the recipe.  I very quickly dipped the lady fingers so that they were barely wet with the coffee.  The recipe came out excellent.  I think tiramisu is all about ingredients (use marscapone, good lady fingers, and good liqueur - I used Kahlua and brandy) AND technique - the whipping of egg whites and folding, and not soaking the lady fingers are key to a good tiramisu.  My original recipe called for some of the coffee/liqueur mixture in the marcapone mixture - I&#039;m not sure if this recipe needs it or not, but it wouldn&#039;t hurt either.  I will definitely make this again - it will be my new standard."},{"name":"arroz c atum","steps":"in a large pan or dutch oven over medium heat , saute onions , garlic , and pepper in olive oil until onion is soft and transparent', 'add tuna , tomatoes , and seasonings', 'cook for about five minutes over medium heat to let flavors blend', 'add rice and water to make 3 cups of liquid', 'bring to a boil', 'let boil for 2 minutes , reduce heat to low', 'cover and simmer till rice is done , about 25 minutes', 'add herbs and serve with a salad'","description":"this is a cape verdean classic. i grew up in an area with a large cape verdean population and this was a common quick, easy, and traditional dinner at several of my friends' houses. for best results use portuguese or cape verdean canned tuna in oil.","ingredients":"onion', 'garlic cloves', 'green pepper', 'olive oil', 'tuna', 'tomatoes', 'cumin', 'hot pepper', 'paprika', 'salt and pepper', 'long grain rice', 'water', 'fresh parsley'","review":"Thank you Syrah!!

I did get slightly over zealous on the rolling out and the thicker ones tasted better than the thinner ones, but that didn't influence the review any. Please see my rating system: I have given 3 stars simply beuase this was nice enough and really not a bad recipe at all. It's just that somehow this combination of flavours just didn't suit us as well as I thought it would when I saw the ingredient list. Maybe it's a simple case of too high expectations of the flavour that would be produced? I would personally go for more garlic if I made this again... maybe we have come to expect stronger flavours since we are such garlic lovers? I think that this is a recipe to experiment with and to work on a combination of flavours (and their strengths) that I would like to have a go at later, becuase I was so certain that I would like this more when I first looked at the recipe.

for the serious bread maker. use your kitchenaid for a lighter inside (perfect for subs and pasta dishes) or make it 100% hand-made which will produce a bread that is more dense and hearty (for

the day before it's needed. the result is three very wonderful artisan loaves of italian bread that is soft and airy on the inside, and light and crunchy on the outside. this recipe is an adaption of

However, if they would manage to make it through the process, they would find that they would be rewarded with the most excellent of spanakopita recipes, and find out why preparing it this way, as opposed to a pie (which is a better beginner recipe) is so much better. The layers of flaky crust are mouthwatering! So if one doesn't mind the added hassle of messing with it (like me), this is definitely the recipe to go with.
