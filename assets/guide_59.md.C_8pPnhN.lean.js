I then put both the cream of potato and the cream of chicken in, but I also added a can of cream of mushroom. I did 3/4 cup of milk, 2 cans of diced potatoes, 2 cans diced peas and carrots, and 1 can of green beans. I also added 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 cup sour cream, and 1/4 pound of Velveeta. This made a really thick and creamy sauce. I added juice from the canned veggies as needed when the sauce was too thick. For seasonings, I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and white pepper. Instead of biscuits, I made crescent rolls, some of which I rolled French's Fried Onions up in. We then poured the crock pot mixture over 1 or 2 crescent rolls depending on what size serving we wanted. It was delicious.

Although, I did add potatoes, and ended up using red onion because that's why my CSA box gave me.  I omitted the fish sauce due to vegetarianess.  Beyond what this recipe called for, I also added some cumin, mustard seed, some curry powder, but in my opinion, most importantly I added brown sugar.  Then I spiced it up some more with chili powder; perhaps if I had used two serrano peppers or left more of the seeds in (I've had issues with making dishes REALLY REALLY spicy before), the chili powder wouldn't have been necessary.<br/><br/>I served it wish rice that I treated with a little bit of lemon juice and cilantro.

I bake a lot, but have not made many pies from scratch so I&#039;m not an expert pie maker by any means.  I used a deep dish frozen pie crust and this made it a snap to put together.  Used three large thin sliced fresh peaches and followed the recipe exactly as written.  It seemed like a lot of liquid was poured in the crust and my peaches were pretty juicy, so I was a bit nervous it would turn out too runny.  Happily this was not the case. I could not quite fit all the topping on the pie since the pan would have been too full, but this did not affect the outcome at all.

I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used a regular pie shell and couldn't use all the filling. Next time based on our tastes, I will change a few things. I think the filling definitely needed some vanilla added. When I think of &quot;Peaches and Cream&quot;, I think peach and vanilla. So the filling was missing this and the sour cream had a bit too much zing. I will also add just a bit more sugar in the filling next time to make it sweeter. The topping was delicious, but I will do half brown sugar and half regular sugar next time. If you wanted to switch it up from the peaches and cream flavor, it would be excellent to add in some cinnamon for a spiced version. Also I used fresh peaches, but this recipe would be just as good with canned peaches if you didn't have fresh available. Overall I loved the recipe. We couldn't decide how we liked it better, warm or cold. We liked it both ways, but warm served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side may have a slight edge. Thank you for the recipe!

I tried one final pancake this time mixing the blueberries in the batter instead of just putting them on top. I cooked that one for well over 5 minutes and, though quite brown, it was mostly done in the center. I threw out the rest of the batter since my kids wouldn't eat the pancakes anyway, and it just wasn't worth taking the time to finish cooking them since the results were so poor.

I would maybe try adding some cornstarch to the flour/cinnamon mixture and maybe dot the pie with butter before I top with the crisp, but you can't beat the flavor, so that's 5 stars in my household!!"},{"name":"lemon pecan sunburst coffee cake","steps":"preheat the oven to 375f', 'grease a 9-inch round cake pan', 'separate the biscuit dough into 8 biscuits', 'place 1 biscuit in the center of the pan', 'cut the remaining biscuits in half , forming 14 half-circles', 'arrange these pieces around the center biscuit in a sunburst pattern , with all the cut sides facing in the same direction', 'i overlapped the circle sides and let the flat sides rest on the bottom of the pan', 'in a small bowl , combine the pecans , granulated sugar , and lemon zest', 'mix well', 'brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter and sprinkle with the pecan mixture', 'bake 20-25 min , or until golden brown', meanwhile , in a small bowl , combine the confectioners' sugar , cream cheese , and enough lemon juice to make a pourable glaze, 'beat until smooth', 'drizzle the glaze over the warm coffee cake', 'let stand for 10 min , or just until the glaze is set', 'serve warm'","description":"this recipe is from the granite steps inn in savannah, georgia. easy and delicious!!","ingredients":"pillsbury grands refrigerated buttermilk biscuits', 'pecans', 'sugar', 'lemon zest', 'butter', confectioners' sugar, 'cream cheese', 'lemon juice'","review":"The taste is great but I could tell I'd have some problems with the texture if I didn't make adjustments, which is why I'm not doing a star rating.

This gives the tomato paste a really strong flavor that flavors the whole dish and really brings out the spices (my in laws use this technique for every dish with tomato in it). Also I used fresh chopped tomato not canned so I didn't have quite enough liquid and a small layer at the top of the rice was not quite cooked so next time I will add a bit more water.

(This was my first time trying caponata, and I've discovered I prefer my veggies warm unless it's a green salad), so I'll base my review on what he said.  This was a wonderful complex blending of flavors!  I loved the number of different types of veggies and spices involved, it allowed for a really complex flavor and a created a gorgeous multicolor salad!   One other note:  the total time involved to make this was much longer for me.  With the roasting and all of the chopping, it was at least 2 hours, maybe closer to 2.5, so be sure you have enough time set aside to make this.  Thanks Rita for posting this unique veggie recipe!

No flavor at all. Everything that went into it smelled wonderful and I marinated the chicken in it for about 4 hours. Maybe it would need to marinate overnight instead since it is more of a mild tasting marinade. Maybe it would also be better on fish instead of chicken. I am so sorry. Maybe someone else will have better luck than I did."},{"name":"lemony veal meatballs","steps":"in a large mixing bowl , combine all ingredients and work mixture until well-combined', 'if mixture is too dry , add 1 tbsp of water or more lemon juice', 'for best results , allow to rest in refridgerator for 30 minutes to allow flavors to combine', 'roll into 1 1 / 2 balls', 'in a large skillet , heat oil and fry meatballs until giolden-brown on all sides', 'instead of frying , you can bake in a shallow baking dish at 375 for about 20 minutes', 'best served without a sauce or just a little tomato sauce'","description":"i got this recipe years ago from an italian cookbook.  these are best served with very little tomato sauce so the delicate flavor is not drowned out by a sauce.\\nprep time includes resting time.","ingredients":"ground veal', 'breadcrumbs', 'parmesan cheese', 'pine nuts', 'egg', 'lemons, zest of', 'lemon juice', 'fresh parsley', 'salt', 'pepper', 'olive oil'","review":"I would give this 5 stars for use with shrimp, but the chicken didn't go over well with my family. We found this marinade to be quite lemon-y and I think it would work well with any seafood, especially if someone doesn't really like that seafood odor/taste because the lemon covered it up well.  I did reduce the oil to 1/4 C and maybe that's why the lemon flavor was more intense.  I used fresh lemon juice, I think it was at least (maybe more) 2 lemons worth to get a half cup, and fresh rosemary which went well with the lemon."},{"name":"lemony vegetable barley pilaf","steps":"barley -- in a medium saucepan , melt the butter on medium heat and add the onion and a little salt and pepper', 'saute just 4-5 minutes', 'add in the barley and cook another 2-3 minutes until coated with the onion butter mixture', 'stir in the broth and bay leaf and bring to a boil', 'reduce to low , and cover', 'cook until just about tender , it will take about 20-25 minutes', 'vegetables -- add in the red pepper and asparagus , cover and cook another , 3-4 minutes until tender', 'the asparagus and red pepper do not take long to cook remove , stir in the lemon juice , zest , scallions and taste for salt and pepper , mix well , re-cover for a couple of minutes and serve'","description":"a simple side dish, and what is so nice with this is you can use any vegetables you like.  i happen to like asparagus and red pepper, but you could use peas, lima beans, broccoli, etc. it does take 25 minutes for the barley cook up, but it is very easy.","ingredients":"pearl barley', 'chicken broth', 'onion', 'asparagus', 'red bell pepper', 'scallions', 'lemon zest', 'lemon juice', 'butter', 'bay leaf', 'salt', 'pepper'","review":"This is so quick and easy and the flavour is divine. The only change I made is to add 4 basil leaves, chopped, to the parsley before adding to the tomatoes. I used fresh Greek feta as well. This dish would be very nice served in individual ramekins - that way each person could use some crusty bread to soak up the juices. Excellent.
