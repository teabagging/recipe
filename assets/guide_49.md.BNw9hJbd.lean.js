I scaled it to two servings, managed to get 5 small patties. i refrigerated them for about 3-4 hours. i didn't have a grill, so i made it on a lightly oiled frying pan. the patties tend to crumble; had to be REAL careful when turning. i also found that it doesn't help when i brushed the teriyaki marinade on the patties. the moisture made them more likely to break apart. a few changes i made to the marinade, i added about 1 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger and 1 tablespoon of mirin (japanese sweet wine). The marinade is really good, i even simmered it, with a little cornstarch, to make a wonderful sauce that i drizzled on the rice just before serving. I think if short grain japanese rice were to be used instead of long grain (which i used), the result would be better, since the grains are stickier and the wedges/patties would stay together better.

I also used egg white instead of egg sub, just measuring it into a 1/4 cup measure.  I actually went over a 1/4 cup by a tiny bit.  I mixed everything together and it looked just fine and smelled lovely.  But now the hard part began.  Because even with the little more egg, this did not stick together at all.  My rice/bulgur mixture was cold.  Everything was done to specifications.  But I could not get it to hold together in burger form.  I started by attempting to cook these on my nonstick griddle which was difficult.  So I switched to a pan and added the oil thinking maybe it needed the oil to bind it.  But that was worse.

I would consider these squares, not cake. Yes, it is hard to spread the batter, but I found after spreading it in chunks, that I could pat it into place. I found the excessive crumbliness to be annoying, as the bars (I only cut 12) did not hold their shape when cut. Also, next time I will try to make my coffee granules smaller; the kind I used did not dissolve in the egg, and the little black flecks gave a strong coffee taste that while I loved, others may not have. The combination of coffee and caramel is wonderful, so I am willing to play with this recipe to get it how I like it. As for the reviewer that asked for advice with the rest of the tin of milk, I say just double the recipe! As for the vanilla, I added about 1/2 t (for a double recipe).

It was a bit vague regarding what seasonings were to be used for the cod, so I tried to echo the flavor of the potatoes: I used rosemary, thyme, oregano, salt & pepper, and a wee bit of lemon juice along with the olive oil. It made for a delicate, almost elegant, piece of fish. As far as the rest of the recipe, I've made a lot of Greek Potatoes, though never with water to cover (or rather, to 'barely cover') but went ahead and followed the recipe as written (well, I spooned out about 1/3 of the water when I turned the potatoes after 45 min; there was still plenty left by the time cooking was done). It worked fine, although they did stay a bit 'brothy' and much softer than usual, and perhaps a bit diluted as far as the seasoning goes (although, in all fairness, I had to use dried oregano; would obviously have been much bolder flavor with fresh herbs) We crumbled some feta over the potatoes as they were served which made up much of the flavor difference, and had steamed spinach with balsamic vinegar on the side (wish I'd had some toasted pine nuts to toss in to complete that Mediterranean flavor!).

Thank you so much for sharing it.  Morrocan food uses many of the same ingredients as North Indian cooking in the Moghul style so I wanted to clarify one thing,  I think this recipe might be calling for Chilli powder, (note the extra l), which is the hot stuff (aka Cayenne powder) instead of Chili powder which is used to make Chili soup, a southwestern dish and usually contains oregano which is NOT used in Moroccan cooking. Most Morrocan dishes use chilli powder (the hot kind) and this recipe calls for 1 tsp of it which should be enough for the stoutest taste buds!  We like things a bit tamer and opted for 1/2 tsp which seemed plenty hot to us!  Also, all the spices can be found cheaply in an East Indian grocery store.

My boyfriend made this for me one night, and he did actually add golden raisins along with the apricots. He also made it using boneless, skinless chicken breasts which we both felt were not the best choice. It needed a *meatier* taste - I think bone-in, skinless thighs would work amazingly with this. We had it with plain couscous and West Indian hot pepper sauce on the side (all we had on hand) to give it some added heat. However, over all this is a totally filling, beautiful combination of flavours and textures.  I should add that I read the review below in which a member mentions that they feel the cooking time is too long, especially for chicken breast meat.  Perhaps their crock pot had a higher temperature setting, because I have our second attempt at this in the crock pot as I type, and it has definitely taken at least three hours to achieve fully cooked chicken, and I think the chickpeas need longer to soften a bit more.  But that's just my opinion. ;-)  Overall, this dish is a stunning combination of flavours and textures, and is totally satisfying and filling.

A few alterations though: I used chicken thighs, which I browned quickly in a pan before adding, instead of breasts. Personally I just loooove chicken thighs. I wasn't able to find ras el hanout, but the substitute spice mix worked wonderfully anyway. I also made a few changes as per the suggestions of drumfish. I omitted the flour, used ketchup and honey, and added lemon zest. My only suggestion is I may omit the chickpeas altogether next time since they were still quite hard even after 8 hours, and clashed a bit with the rest of the dish texturally.

All I needed was to spend 15 minutes making a quick pot of couscous (using chicken broth to make it, and stirring in some golden raisins, slivered almonds and a few tablespoons of butter at the end to make it delicious!) and a warm, hearty and delicious dinner was on the table, with everyone enjoying it! I used all the spices called for, and topped the dish with fresh chopped cilantro, but did not make the other spice mixture. Perhaps next time. Thank you so much French Tart for contributing this flavorful and special meal, that's easy enough for a weeknight post-game dinner! This is good enough to serve for company too! <br/>**One side note is that I'd say this makes enough to serve 10-12 people, not 6! So the nutritional values look high as is. But dividing it in half, they're more reasonable. 5 of us ate tonight, and we didn't get through half of it! It makes a lot!

I'll post back a review when I get the chance to try this. Thank you for the simple idea!  UPDATE!  Wee, I'm the first to review this!  I made this last night; this was soooo flavorful, even before adding the seasonings.  I used Herb Ox brand sodium-free chicken boullion & only cooked 2 large potatoes, which made 2 very large servings.  I made enough chicken broth to make 3 cups, cut the potatoes in 8ths & boiled on med-high for about 40mins or until potatoes were very tender.  The liquid had also cooked down just less than halfway.  I drained that into a measuring cup, mashed up potatoes in the pan with a fork, added about half of the cooking broth & just eyeballed the seasonings, tasting a bit as I went.  My bf gives this 4 stars and said it was pretty good, but I give this 5.  I ended up w/leftovers, so I refrigerated the remaining mashies with a little bit of the broth so that when I reheated next day, they still had plenty of moisture.  I also saved what was left of the cooking broth b/c I plan on making this again in the next day or less. :)  I did have to peel the potatoes b/c I can't easily digest potato peel even tho I love it.

I couldn't find ground or crushed fennel at my local grocery store. You can find it online at the giant book store. I also thought I had onion powder when, in fact, it was diced onions. I tried crushing these items by hand but got tired of that and just threw a little extra in. So I heated the sauce because it was thinner than I'd like and I wanted to draw some more flavor out of the uncrushed ingredients. With that said, I'm going to try again with the prescribed ingredients. This sauce isn't as spicy as I had hoped for and still gives off a bit more of the tomato sweetness than I think a pizza sauce should. Next time, not only will I used onion powder and ground fennel, I will double up on the crushed red pepper. Then I will add more black pepper to taste. If necessary. This recipe, as is, makes a pretty good sauce that will beat the sauce out of any frozen pizza I've ever eaten. It's my personal desire for more heat and less sweet that's got me writing this review.

I have baked plain water bagels and pumpernickel bagels many times using recipes from KAF and The Bread Baker's Apprentice, and Secrets of a Jewish Baker.  Being a household of one and not certain as to how these GF bagels would taste, I decided to test with half the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Before baking, I brushed the tops with egg wash and sesame seeds.  I was disappointed at how these turned out.  The first problem is that the bagels were not done in the recipe's time range.  I ended up with about 26-1/2 minutes before they were nicely browned.  I was concerned about the 375-degree temperature because my other bagel recipes use 425.  This concern was supported by the fact that the bagels were a little doughy despite the longer baking time.  I made sure to gauge the temperature with an oven thermometer.  If I decide to make these again, I will use the higher temperature.  The is not likely because in addition to the texture problems, the taste was just not good.

There are a few changes I&#039;d like to see made with this recipe just for clarity... first off, I&#039;d rather have the measurements for the cornstarch and potato starch in weight rather than volume, it&#039;s more accurate and produces more consistent results.  I&#039;d also like to see the author list whether they intended for rapid rise or standard yeast to be used.  I used standard and it worked out fine, but it&#039;s still good to know.  Also the size of egg should be listed as well.  So much in gluten free baking is a delicate balance of ingredients, it&#039;s important to be as accurate as possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With that said, I found the texture to be acceptable (though I&#039;ll try to refine my mixing and shaping to make a more smooth exterior).  The taste, as others have mentioned, is pretty darn bland.  A great canvas if you plan on adding flavors of your own, but not so great if you&#039;re just wanting plain bagels.  When shaping, I found it helpful to dust my hands and a cutting board with cornstarch to make handling the dough easier.  I may also try letting these rise after shaping for 15 minutes or so to see if some of the yeast-y flavor will develop.  I did get 6 standard size bagels out of the recipe, which is excellent when the frozen Udi&#039;s bagels are nearly $7 for 4 at the only grocery store in the area that carries them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m really overall fairly happy with the recipe.

Additionally, I first used a strainer to sift and mix  all of the dry ingredients thoroughly (I don&#039;t have a stand mixer and kneaded dry &amp; wet together by hand). The bagels didn&#039;t rise that much so there wasn&#039;t a need to make such a big hole. They were dense and chewy, but I like that. The final product was definitely on par with gluten free options you might find in a bagel store, even better in some cases!

to experience many things. some good, some bad. some things that you remember and many things that you forget. once in a while some thing, experience or event comes along that stays with you and provides many nice memories. one such thing for me was a coney dog. not just any coney dog, mind you. but one that stands out ?nonpareil. the ultimate coney dog. a poor man‚Äôs gastronomical delight. one that shall never come this way again. for it just wasn‚Äôt the taste of that coney dog among coney dogs: it was the aura of a bygone era. not only did the sauce-covered wiener satisfy your appetite, but the smells, sounds and sights of the surroundings made the consumption of this king of coney dogs an event to the looked forward to, cherished and remembered for years to come. in the old days in canton, ohio, there was an indoor version of a farmer‚Äôs market called the arcade market in downtown canton where one could get the freshest produce, meat cut to order on the spot, actually homemade items for your home and, of course, breakfast and lunch. homer e. dickes (dick), a spry wisp of a man who seemed old even when i first met him as a 5-year-old kid, owned two eating venues within the old arcade. one was a sit-down counter that served lunch and breakfast. you could get that day‚Äôs version of fast food there, eggs made to order, various sandwiches, sodas and shakes, but there was one thing you couldn‚Äôt get there: that was a coney dog. for that you had to amble over toward the other side of the market, elbow your way up to a counter where mr. dickes himself served up coney dogs par excellence at dick‚Äôs coney stand. during the rush at lunchtime you sometimes had to stand five deep and hope you got served in time to get back to work. lunch, at least in my working years, consisted of two coney dogs washed down by an ice cold root beer. mr. dickes would take your order, grab his tongs and deftly fish the required number of wieners from  a pot where they had been simmering since early morning. he would then take a bun or buns from a steam warmer and with a quick flick of the wrist using a long soda spoon put the perfect amount of sauce on your dog. an assistant would bring your root beer and take your money while mr. dickes methodically waited on the next customer. in the 30 or 40 years that i frequented dick‚Äôs coney stand i don‚Äôt think i ever heard mr. dickes saying anything more that ‚Äúwhat can i get you he was much too busy for chit-chat and i was much too eager to consume my prize dogs to want to converse with him anyhow. those days are long gone now, but the memories linger on. the arcade market was slowly pushed aside by the newly arrived aseptic and extremely mundane super markets. dickes coney stand held its own against the fast food restaurants that started to populate downtown canton, but even the popularity of his coneys couldn‚Äôt sustain the arcade market and keep it open. the arcade market finally lost its battle to serve the citizens of canton and with its closing dick‚Äôs coney stand served its last coney dog some time during the '80s. after its closing, i, along with others, would search in vain for a coney that was comparable to mr. dickes? at times i would come across one that was reasonably good but the ambiance ?the sights, sounds and smells of the old arcade market ?could not be replicated from that earlier time. \\nfor years i had heard rumors that someone had the actual recipe for mr. dickes?coney sauce. i was eventually given a copy of said recipe by a friend and eagerly set about making it in my home. what i was given was a pretty standard recipe for coney sauce that didn‚Äôt seem to be anything special and indeed my first few attempts at making the coney sauce didn‚Äôt produce the hoped for results. it took quite a few tries before i discovered that the secret to a good coney sauce wasn‚Äôt in the ingredients but it was in the preparation. like all things of import, the effort put into creating something ?whether it be a food item, a material object, or even a work of art ?directly impacts the final result. you can use the finest ingredients, building materials or artist paints, but if individual effort is lacking, the finished item will leave something to be desired. a quick search of the internet revealed a couple recipes that were attributed to mr. dickes. the one that i offer here is one that has been circulated for years by word of mouth and is popularly thought to be the original recipe from dick‚Äôs coney sauce. for many years now i have served this sauce to friends and family and it is now known in my somewhat limited circle as ken‚Äôs famous coney sauce. i have freely given out the recipe but invariably i get feedback from others that they just can‚Äôt make it the same way as i do. that is probably because of the required amount of effort that it takes to make a truly great coney sauce. it takes a couple hours of intense motivated effort to make the sauce come out right. an effort that most won‚Äôt put forth for a lowly wiener.","ingredients":"tomato puree', 'sugar', 'dark chili powder', 'lean
