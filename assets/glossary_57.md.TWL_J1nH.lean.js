Therefore I have not eaten a burger here in The Netherlands for at least 5 years, but today I had a craving for one and as usual came to Zaar to finially make my own. Why did I wait so long This was JUST what I wanted, a recipe that kept the meat soft and juicy while it cooked ALL the way though :) Wonderful ! DO add the fried onions, salad green, gurkins and tomato... but expecially have this with the fried onions because it goes really well with the milder burger taste and lifts it away from boring. The patties held together well in the pan and cooking them over a medium to low heat ensured through cooking while the potato helped it not dry out. Good move. We will be eating burgers more often than every 5 years from now on!

I like the fruity notes in combination with the flavour of the galicien mussels. As a side I served oven baked potato wedges. And of cause baguette and white wine.

I cooked the barley for 30 minutes and then added the carrots and celery and then the sauteed leeks and mushrooms.  I continued cooking for another 30 minutes and then added the cooked chicken.

A few hints will help! First, I did not transfer to a bowl but just added the cold liquids gradually while pulsing the food processor.  Then plop the dough onto 2 pieces of plastic wrap and use the wrap to gather up the dough and form it into disks and wrap up. (The dough will seem to be impossibly wet!!) I recommend chilling at least 2 hours or freezing for a half hour.  You really can use a good bit of flour when rolling out; do it between sheets of wax paper or just use the plastic wrap the disk was wrapped in on the counter.  Brush off excess flour from the dough surface. Chill 15 minutes after rolling out and then chill another 40 minutes in the pie plate.  For a baked crust, bake at 400 degrees on lowest oven rack wiith pie weights for 15 minutes then unweighted another 5 to 10 minutes until golden brown, shielding the edges if necessary. <br/>(I keep my pie weights in a large cooking bag (made for cooking a turkey).

Fortunately, the beeriness mellowed out to a background taste with a bit more simmering. Since we're all avocado lovers as well (and I needed a quick-ish side dish), I also made the Avocados with Creamy Maque Choux. Very nice combo that made for a lovely dinner (DH is used to me cooking this sort of stuff, since I participate in every PAC I can, but I think his brother that's now living with us is getting spoiled with all the yummy recipes I've been trying!).

I don't believe the mushiness was caused by overcooking so I got on the net to do some research.  What I found out is the Arrowtooth flounder, the kind commonly found in west coast supermarkets, releases an enzyme into the flesh shortly after death which makes the fish mushy and basically inedible.  East coast flounder doesn't have that enzyme.  Arrowtooth flounder is found in waters from Mexico to Alaska, so if you live in the western states, chances are you're going to get mushy flounder.  This is my second experiece with it.  My recommendation is only use flounder that was flown in from the east coast or use another kind of fish.  It's really a shame that supermarkets continue to sell something that's inedible when the fishing industry is well aware that Arrowtooth is not a good eating fish.

Also, I salted and peppered the potatoes because that is where it was needed. I did put a little cajun seasoning in the eggs, which I used 8 instead of 10, as that is all my pan would hold. I omitted that bell peppers, as we do NOT like those.\\nNext time, I am going to add some mushrooms into the eggs as well as 2 or 3 tablespoons of white onions into the potatoes when I sautee them. \\nOverall, a great breakfast if you are willing to put some time and effort into cooking it.

I can't say this very often, but I followed the ingredients exactly. I found the dough to be very soft and sticky, even after chilling overnight, and no matter what method I tried, I couldn't get it to roll out without making a mess. I ended up rolling the dough into small balls, placed a piece of floured wax paper over the ball and pressed with a cup. The dough, uncooked deserves 5+ stars - it was soooo good, I could hardly stop eating it. The cookies have a nice orangey taste but the texture is odd, I think because of having the egg but no leavening, and it's hard to describe, kind of like a stale sugar cookie. The frosting is very good,though a little sweet, and really makes the cookie. The orange juice made the frosting look curdled. I baked the dough in two batches and added some orange food coloring to the frosting of the second batch , which was nice as the first were pretty plain looking. I'd like to make these again and add some baking powder to see if it would improve the texture. I think a lot of people will like them anyway, especially if they are an orange fan.

I just mixed this up this afternoon and I've already had 3 cups.  It's just so good!  I've been filling a cup about 3/4 full with boiling water, stirring in the mix and then topping it off with about 1/4 cup milk.  That way it's cool enough to drink right away!  When I first mixed this up in my blender, I smelled it as I was scraping the sides and I thought, Uh oh!  What have I done  It smells kind of... well, gross to be honest.  BUT, the taste is great, and the unsavory smell is much less noticable in the mug than in the concentrated mix.  I don't know why it smells like that... maybe its just something about the carob?  I'm really excited about this, actually.  It tastes even better than I expected.  I think that it is wonderful using the carob in this way, and I find the taste to be somewhere between coffee and hot cocoa, which makes it a really lovely breakfast drink.  I think the cinnamon is a really nice touch- it is not particularly dominant, but it gives this a little more flavor than just carob, which is nice.  I also like that this is made with powdered milk- that way you get a rich, creamy drink, even if you just mix this with water.  I used organic toasted carob, organic non-instant milk, organic cinnamon and raw wildflower honey, and this is just wow!  with the flavor!  I love coffee and teas, but I really enjoy having an instant hot drink.  I was drinking instant coffee for a while, but I dont need all that caffeine and the flavor isnt the best.  This gives me an instant drink that I can mix up just as fast as I can get the water to boil.  Lots of healthy stuff in this too, so I can feel good about drinking it!  Did you know that carob contains as much vitamin B1 as asparagus or strawberries, the same amount of niacin as lima beans, lentils or peas, and more vitamin A than eggplant, asparagus and beets?  It's also high in vitamin B2, calcium, magnesium and iron.  So, drink up!
