I tend to like a sweet summer peach pie and would recommend omitting the ginger altogether if that is what you are looking for. I added a 6th peach and substitued 1/3 c flour for the cornstarch. I do not like adding cornstarch or tapioca to my pies as I think it alters the flavor and sometimes makes them too congealed. I like a little bit of juice to add to that home made effect. Also, if you are making a spicy peach pie you could add a 1/4 t of nutmeg for an extra boost of flavor. All in all this is a good pie recipe and I would definitely make again.

I was debating whether it is Outstanding or Great.  The taste is outstanding. I had 2 minor problems with preparation.  First, I used Mean Chef's Sweet Tart dough, as suggested.  My dilemma was that I did not know at what temp and how long to prebake the tart shell, per step 1. I decided on 350 for 15 minutes. I don't think that was really enough, as the bottom of the shell ended up a bit soggy. My second technical difficulty was that I seemed to have too much 'filling' for a  9 tart pan. I even used fairly small apples.  What this meant is that I had a pretty well heaped pile of apples in my tart shell. Then I had to scatter on the walnuts and then the topping. I think because of the very domed shape, the topping ended up being rather thick in parts. This made it a little difficult to slice up nicely.  I think I shall either find a larger tart pan, use less apples, or maybe even mix a little of the walnuts and topping into the apples for the bottom layer.  Despite what sounds like compaints, please do not consider them so. These were really just a few minor items that are easily fixed."},{"name":"oven fried crispy chicken","steps":"heat oven to 350 degrees f', 'line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or foil', 'in shallow bowl or pie plate , combine the rice cereal , parmesan , oil , paprika , cumin , 1 / 2 t salt and 1 / 4 t pepper', 'brush both sides of the chicken with the yogurt and coat with the cereal mixture , pressing gently to help it adhere', 'place on the prepared baking sheet', 'bake until golden brown and cooked through , 25-30 minutes'","description":"this chicken comes out moist and delicious with a crispy coating.","ingredients":"crispy rice cereal', 'parmesan cheese', 'olive oil', 'paprika', 'ground cumin', 'kosher salt', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'low-fat plain yogurt', 'boneless skinless chicken breasts'","review":"This was DELICIOUS!

I have dreams about this beef. You may think you&#039;ve had great beef before, but until you&#039;ve had this you have not had the greatest beef you will ever eat. I am lucky in that a local grocery store has a sale a few times a year on Australian free range, grass fed whole beef tenderloin for half what you would expect to pay for such a cut of meat. I cut the whole tenderloin into two 2 lb. roasts and the balance from the skinniest end (a whole tenderloin is usually around 5 lbs.) into steaks. I wrap the roasts in plastic wrap, then foil, and then place in a Ziplock bag - my usual &quot;cheap meat&quot; just goes straight into the Ziplock - to freeze for whatever special occasion deserves THE Beef. First cooking tip: line your baking sheet with foil because that crust will stick to your pan and soaking it off will take forever! Second tip: I use an electronic meat thermometer that you stick in the meat before it goes in the oven (the probe is on a long heat proof cord) and has an alarm when the meat reaches the proper temperature - but make sure you seal the crust around the thermometer probe very well. Third tip: be very exact about how long the meat rests in the crust - if you leave it in too long it will keep cooking and not be rare; even a few minutes too long can overcook your roast! Yes, it&#039;s a job to cook this roast - but it is so very worth the work!

I&#039;m really glad I did, because this stuff is addictive! I did have to make a few changes based on availability (and ability to fully open the recipe &gt;:x ). I used Quaker Whole Hearts for the Cheerios, and pretzel twists instead of sticks (same taste, just different shapes). I couldn&#039;t locate any Bugles, so I used a mix of corn Chex and queso fundido flavored Cheez-It Zings (the Chex for a similar Bugles crunch, the Zings because they sounded good). I had mixed all the crunchies together last night, but DH wanted to watch a movie, so I bagged it and decided to coat and bake it today. When I went to check the recipe for seasoning amounts, I could only get the top half of the recipe to open, so I guessed 1 tsp of chili powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. AFTER I finished baking it, the recipe decided to fully load, and I noticed that I used double the seasoning. I think I will make all future batches with &quot;screwed up&quot; seasoning, because it was delicious!

The one problem I had is that the batter was a bit wet, and, as a result, the muffins turned out a bit...um...loose grained?  They don't really hold together as well nor are they as puffy as other bran muffin recipes I've enjoyed.  I think the quanity of milk could probably be reduced or the amount of oil- I feel that they're a tad oilier than they really need to be.  I made a half recipe since I only have 2 6-cup muffin tins and I didn't really want to make 2 batches.

Proportionally I used rather more salmon because the can I had was larger so several other ingredients ended up being somewhat scaled up! And I ended up with one smaller pie, in addition to the pie in the main dish: a bonus which went straight into the freezer! I used Lali's Bisquick Clone Recipe #12648, low-fat milk, to cut the calories a tad, and I added three cloves of garlic (a must-include ingredient for me with the salmon and basil). I've always found that using low-fat milk makes no discernible difference to recipes, but I'd rather omit cheese than use what to me is tasteless low-fat cheese. The Swiss cheese in this dish blended perfectly with the other flavours. A truly delicious dish, and the leftovers from the first meal reheated - in the microwave - without any loss of flavour.

It is a family favorite. I make a few small (but worthwhile) changes, first, I sautee chicken breasts in a little oil and butter, then shred or cube the meat, add the BBQ sauce, and let it simmer to absorb the flavor. Then I use Green Giant Mexicorn (with red pepper) to save time. I do not put the cheese or lettuce in the black bean/onion/tomato mixture, it just gets soggy, for each salad, I put down a layer of lettuce, then the corn/bean relish, then chicken, then dressing, and top it off with the cheese and olives. Lastly, I ALWAYS serve it in a flour tortilla shell bowl! Just place a burrito sized flour tortilla in a metal (or other oven proof) bowl of appropriate size, (prick it a few times to prevent bubbles) Or use a tortilla shell bowl form which is what I have.

The coconut milk was oozing and it probably made a difference in the intensity of the flavor.  Note - there is a huge difference between a young tender coconut (pipa, here in Costa Rica) and an older one (coco).  If using fresh, you have to use the more mature coconut.

They were easy and so tasty.  We will surely make them again.  Since I can&#039;t ever leave well enough alone, we used a food processor which made the whole process a snap.  In addition, we happened to making cheddar broccoli soup too, so when we grated too much sharp cheddar, we decide to add it to the biscuits:D.  I am talking like nearly 2 cups of loosely grated cheese! After we made the biscuit dough in the processor, we gently patted out a rectangle and tossed some of the cheese on top, folded it, added more cheese and repeated a few times being careful not to over work the dough. Then we gently pushed the dough into a loosely 1 inch thick rectangle and sliced it lengthwise once and across 3 times creating 8 equal size biscuits.  No waste and easy that way.    It was soooo good.  The biscuits raised just fine and even though they seemed slightly dense in areas, I am pretty sure it only had to do with all the cheese oil seeping into the bread (oh bummer- not!).  With something this easy, why would anyone buy a can a biscuits?

The recipe was a bit strange. I could not see how 1 large portabella can feed 6 people or more, so I used a package of smaller portabellinis. (All these veggies shrink considerably when roasting). The ingredients and instructions are very meagre: for example, surely most of the juice should be pressed from the tomato slices? I did do that. Did not have zucchinis, but used an equivalent veggie, a round South African baby gem squash which tastes just like zucchini. I made a dressing by whisking the wine, olive oil, black pepper and some mustard together, and then sprinkling over the veggies. Then I used a mixed-flavours seasoning salt liberally, as well as snipped rosemary over. In spite of greasing the oven tin the veggies still stuck, and was hard to get out in whole shapes. The baking time was a litle short. I apologise for not having red onions, so used a sweet onion.
