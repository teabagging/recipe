I cut the recipe in half and it made 6 muffins. The only changes I made was to add a little nutmeg, and left out the raisins which DH doesn't like. This muffin has a little bit of a dense texture, I think because of the quantity of fat with the applesauce, next time I make them, I will cut back on the butter a little and sub more applesauce; I would also cut back on the sugar as the cake part of the muffin is very sweet and more so with the topping ( I even used unsweetened applesauce). The crumble is more than enough - I had almost as much left over as I used, so I saved it for the next muffins I make. I like the touch a clove it's not overpowering but adds a little nuance.

I accidentally left out the raisins and was kinda worried that the muffins would be dry and not very flavourful without them, but I neednt have worried. They were still very tasty with a wonderful cinnamon flavour and nice crunch from the topping. Next time though I will definitely put in more applesauce, cause I couldnt taste it as much as I would have liked to. Like momaphet I too did have half of the crumb topping as left over so just used it for making individual apple-rhubarb crumbles with some compote I happened to have on hand. I did cut back a lot on the butter (only used 1/3 cup in the batter and 1/4 cup in the crumb topping) and I might even use less next time. Also used only 1/4 cup of sugar, which was perfect for me. \\nMy only problem with this recipe was that I had some trouble blending in the butter with the other ingredients. I think it would have been better to melt it and then add it to the batter. But other than that a great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing this lovely recipe with us, kittycatmom!

Since it is blanched, it is very mild. I love garlic. I would go so far as to double it. I enjoyed the dressing very much. In a half recipe I added 1 chipotle chili, which made for a medium-spicy salad. Perfect for me. I like the dressing very much and would consider using it for other things as well. Or making variations on this salad with possibly other ingredients added in such as tomatoes, other greens, or peppers. This recipe does make 6 side-dish size servings. I like lots of veggies though.

I am thrilled to have found this recipe, thank you so much. The thick soy sauce really lets the sweet potato flour stick better onto the pieces of chicken, than does just using regular soy sauce as was in the other recipe. Both were delectably delicious, however this version takes the cake. <br/><br/>My only issue I've found when I served it was, my family wished it was a bit more crunchy. That could be because I needed to gather more starch onto the chicken slices! I will try to pack more together very closely and see if that solves my problem! <br/><br/>I also read another recipe in which after they fry the pieces of meat, they stuff more sweet potato starch on top of that and refry it... I will see if that helps also.<br/><br/>Again, thanks so much for this delicious recipe!

I used plain applesauce with a little bit of cinnamon added The first one I made was a little gooey and not as flavorful as I would have liked since I was eating them absolutely plain with no butter, no syrup, etc. (This may have also been since I didn't use sweetened applesauce.) I think it would have been fine with syrup. But since I wasn't using syrup, I decided to add some brown sugar to the batter. I added a loosely packed tablespoon to 1/4 of a batch. In hindsight, I could have used a bit less. The next four small pancakes I made turned out a little thin, kind of like crepes, but the texture was good, and the flavor was too! So my advice to anyone making this recipe is: 1. Make sure you use sweetened cinnamon applesauce. 2. Let the batter sit for a few minutes to activate the baking powder. 3. Make sure your pan is hot enough to melt a small dab of butter completely within a few seconds of hitting the pan. and 4. If you do not like the flavor of the first pancake you make, add a little brown sugar to the batter to sweeten it up."},{"name":"diane s apple dew tart","steps":"preheat oven to 350 degrees and coat a 13x9 baking dish or pan with a non-stick spray', 'peel and slice each apple into 16 pieces', 'wrap apples in crescent rolls , and place rolled slices in pan , making 2 rows', 'place additional apple slices between the rolled slices and between the rows', 'mix melted butter , sugar and cinnamon together', 'pour mixture over wrapped apples', 'pour the can of mountain dew over all ingredients in pan', 'sprinkle with additional cinnamon', 'bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown', 'serve with vanilla ice cream -- enjoy !'","description":"this recipe is from diane sawyer on good morning america.  i havent tried it yet but wanted to post if for safe keeping.  it looked so yummy on the show and so easy to make.","ingredients":"crescent rolls', 'granny smith apples', 'sugar', 'butter', 'cinnamon', 'mountain dew soda'","review":"These really were fantastic!

DH requested a pound cake for Easter dessert, so I went looking.  I love the Cake Mix Dr, and have prepared many of her recipes, but not this one.  I already knew it would be delicious. And can we say easy?  Sheesh, you just throw everything in the bowl at once, and mix.   The flavor is amazingly good, and the family loved it.  I served it with a mix of blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries that I mixed with some sugar and almond extract, and some fresh whipped cream.  Heavenly!  I baked mine at 350 for just a bit less than 45 minutes, because my tube pan is dark nonstick, and I didn't want the edges of the cake to burn.  It was perfectly done.
