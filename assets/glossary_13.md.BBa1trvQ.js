Only diff: I did not have caraway seeds and used a generous measure of a Cape breyani spice mixture. But although the taste was great, it's the consistency of this loaf which won me over. Usually my meat loaves are too dense, which this one is not. I used a lovely pure rye bread, and after breaking it up, poured the beer over it and left it for a while.

When I was ready to serve, I cut the tomato up into large wedges and mixed up another serving of marinade and dressed the salad again.

You can find this recipe in this link: http://www.greek-recipe.com/salad-from-constantinopolis/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do not doubt that this could be a nice salad, although I expressed my concerns especially about preserving cut tomatoes in the fridge but definitely is not a Greek Salad."},{"name":"bacon and egg tacos","steps":"in a skillet cook the bacon until crisp', 'remove to a plate', 'in a bowl whisk the eggs with cream , baking powder , salt and pepper until well combined , then add in the cooked bacon', 'heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat until sizzling', 'pour the egg mixture into the skillet and cook until almost firm but still slightly watery', 'add in the cheese and cook gently stirring until the eggs are just cooked and the cheese has melted', 'spoon about 1 / 4 cup or a little more down the center of each warm tortilla , then sprinkle a small amount of green onions over the egg mixture', 'fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling', 'you may place the rolled tortillas in a baking dish , cover with foil and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve', 'serve with salsa'","description":"this makes a great weekend brunch, all ingredient amounts may be adjusted to taste, i also add in a pinch of cayenne pepper to the eggs, the baking powder will make the eggs very fluffy, you may omit if desired but i suggest to add it in, wrap the tortillas in foil and warm in the oven at 200 degrees f while making the eggs, serve the tortillas with salsa :)","ingredients":"bacon', 'eggs', 'whipping cream', 'baking powder', 'ground black pepper', 'salt', 'butter', 'cheddar cheese', 'green onions', 'tortillas', 'salsa'","review":"This was a great recipe and easy to make.

Her test showed her to be borderline for gestational diabetes.  She loves bread but she is picky and doesn't like wheat bread so I figured she wasn't going to like this, but it was worth a try.  I did make some changes as per the suggestions of another reviewer because I wanted the best chance of my daughter-in-law liking this the first time, for her own good!  She liked it, ate it untoasted the first time, and wants me to make a batch with cinnamon and raisins!  If you can't have carbs then this is a 5 star way to get that bread fix.  I didn't like it at first bite, then I tryed it again and liked it more.  Then I toasted it as suggested by other reviewers.  I liked it.  OK here's what I did.  I followed one of the reviewers advice to add 1/2 teaspoon more of yeast to ensure rising.  I also added 1 scant teaspoon of sugar in place of the Splenda, just for the first try.  I also added 1teaspoon of salt.  Next time I am going to make it with the Splenda and only 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I could taste the scant teaspoon of salt but nobody else could.  I also put my crust setting on dark brown which gives the outside a toasted taste right from the beginning.  At first I was really turned off by the sponginess so the other thing I did was to cut the whole loaf into slices and put it in a baggie but I left the baggie open for 4 hours.  This allowed it to dry out just a little, voila - much less sponginess, which is the point at which my daughter-in-law tryed it.  Try this and don't stop at the first bite, it's just different so keep that in mind.  But if you seriously can't have carbs you will like it.  Keep an open mind and know that it will be different than you're used to.  And I agree it's at it's best toasted with butter, but I can see it being good as a sandwich too, with mayo.  I was shocked that even my husband liked it.  Usually if he knows a regular food item is altered to be healthy, his mind set is to dislike it and he knew it was going to be made with weird healthy things.

I doubled the original recipe because I don?t have a bread pan small enough for just a 1 lb loaf and my bread machine really doesn?t like making 1 lb loaves at all. This recipe makes a really quite good loaf with far fewer carbs than even the commercial ?low carb? loves such as Healthy Life brand. To figure servings, weigh the finished loaf and use that weight to figure servings. For example, I have a scale that will weigh in grams so my loaf of bread weighed 708 grams. When I entered the recipe in the MyFitnessPal.com recipe function, I listed the recipe as having 708 servings. Then, when I weigh my slices of bread, I just enter that many grams as how many servings I had. The 2 slices I had earlier to make a grilled cheese were only 107 calories total and 3 grams of carbs. \\n\\nFlavor is strongly of whole wheat. For my grill cheese, I only used 2 slices of Kroger thin sliced Colby jack and probably should have doubled that. While the wheat flavor is not at all bad, it is quite strong so make sure anything you put with it for sandwiches or spreads is just as strong flavored or it would be a waste. My first 2 loaves, I didn?t like the shape of at all. Not really tall enough, but that wasn?t the fault of the recipe. Most of my bread pans were designed for the standard 2 lb loaves I normally make with regular flour for my friends. The best size loaf pan I have found (because, yes, you can bake the whole blessed thing in the bread machine; however, I hate that stupid hole in the bottom of the bread with an absolute passion so I just use the dough cycle and then let it rise and bake in a bread pan) is 8 &frac12;? X 4 &frac12;? X 2 5/8?. Also be aware that this bread seems to take a bit longer to get to its full loft. I have been allowing a full 1 &frac12; - 2 hours rise rather than the hour I give my normal conventional breads. Don?t forget to ask at your favorite grocery bakery department if they would mind slicing your homemade bread on their fancy slicer so you get nice even slices. I am a serious regular at our local Kroger store since I am trying to eat fresh vegetables rather than canned or frozen and the store isn?t more than a couple of minutes from where I go and work out 3 times a week. I get most if not all of my ingredients at this store so they were quite happy to cut my loaf for me. \\n\\nI would recommend for the first loaf, just so you can get a taste and decide if it?s something you want on a regular basis, get your ingredients at your local grocery if you can. After that, the best price I have found, for the vital wheat gluten at least, is on Amazon.com. Also, if you do the Swagbucks.com thing, you can save up your swagbucks to ?buy? amazon gift cards and reduce your price further. \\n\\nOh and they don?t include any salt in the original recipe?. I have made salt free bread by accident before. It?s not good, believe me. The salt helps regulate the rate of yeast growth and makes for better texture. I add &frac34; teaspoon of salt to the doubled recipe I make and also increase the yeast to 1 tablespoon. Yup, more than double it, but that?s a weird quark of yeast."},{"name":"bacon county  georgia peachy pizza  rsc","steps":"dough:', 'a', 'combine instant yeast , bread flour , kosher salt in a food processor', 'pulse the ingredients 3 times for 5 seconds for each pulse then stop', 'b', 'add 1 cup of warm water and 2 tablespoons oil through the feeding tube and turn on processor for 30 seconds', 'celsius then add additional water , a little at a time until the mixture becomes a ball', 'this ball will be slightly sticky to the touch', 'd', 'turn dough onto floured surface and kneed by hand until dough forms into a smooth , round ball', this step shouldn't take very long, 'e', 'grease a bowl with 1 / 2 teaspoon of remaining olive oil and place dough in the bowl', 'cover bowl with dough inside using a damp cloth and let rise in a warm area that is free of drafts until dough doubles , approximately 1 1 / 2 to 2 hours', 'f', 'once risen , roll dough into two 10 inch rounds', 'sauce:', '1) in a large pot , heat extra virgin olive oil over medium heat , then add red crushed peppers if you elect to use them maybe a pinch , then add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic , stirring continuously so that garlic does not burn', 'cook until aeromatic which takes about a minute', '2) add chopped medium onion and saute until onion is translucent', '3) add crushed tomatoes and lemon zest and simmer until sauce thickens , which takes about 20 minutes', '4) carefully remove from heat and allow to cool', 'toppings:', do recommend what's best for you, 'fry bacon on both sides until fully cooked and crisp', 'once cooked set aside , on towel to drain and crumble', 'reserve in a separate cup', 'slice 12 ounces of fresh mozerella into thin slices', 'set aside on plate', 'in a separate bowl mix cream cheese with goat cheese', 'set aside', 'thouroughly wash , peel , pit the ripe peaches', 'cut into 1 / 4 inch slices and set aside', 'assembly:', 'preheat oven to 450 degrees f', 'cut two long sheets of reynolds wrap aluminum foil', 'you may fold in half if you wish', 'very lightly spray 2 generous sheets of reynolds wrap aluminum foil , shiny side with pam', 'place one pizza dough round in the center of each sheet', 'there should be enough excess foil to allow you to lift the pizza carefully', 'brush each pizza dough round with olive oil , be sure to brush the edges', 'spread thin layer of sauce on the dough of each pizza allowing for a one inch border all the way around the dough', 'then add mozzarella , spinkle peaches evenly , crumbled bacon , use a spoon to finish the topping with the cream cheese / goat cheese mixture', 'place both pizzas in the oven', 'cook for 12 - 16 minutes', 'carefully rotate pizza when time is half way through to allow for even cooking', 'watch for when crust and cheese is lightly golden brown in color', 'carefully remove from oven , cut into slices', '<serve and enjoy ! >'","description":"ready, set, cook!  reynolds wrap contest entry.  this recipe was inspired from richard blais's top chef entry of pizza with peaches and sweet tea. he didn't win that year but he persevered and went on to victory!\\n\\ni was looking for authentic bacon from georgia to make this more authentic and found that there really was a bacon county, so the name sort of evolved to bacon county, geogia peachy pizza. i'll admit i've never been there, but would love to go. imagine if they liked my pizza! if they didn't, i'd better have my ticket ready to fly home...(laughing)","ingredients":"extra virgin olive oil', 'onion', 'crushed tomatoes', 'garlic cloves', 'salt', 'black pepper', 'crushed red pepper flakes', 'lemon zest', 'bread flour', 'instant yeast', 'olive oil', 'warm water', 'sea salt', 'fresh mozzarella cheese', 'peaches', 'smoked bacon', 'goat cheese', 'cream cheese', 'nonstick cooking spray', 'reynolds wrap foil'","review":"Made this bread for the first time lastnight before I left for my part time job.

Second, let me say that I did not follow your recipe to a tee. :(  I did mix lemon juice and butter to dredge the fish in. Then I mixed flour and Old Bay with some garlic pepper for the breading. I double-dipped!! :) Which means I dipped in butter, then breading, then back into the butter, then back into the breading. WHEW!!!   This was great!! There was just the right amount of lemon that really added to the flavor! I will make this a regular to my family menu! Fish has been a little scarce in our home because of the price, but this fish is inexpensive and tastes great too. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Very easy and great way to get your recommended fish servings in each week.  I also baked this along with some potatoes that I sliced in half.  I lined a cookie sheet with two pieces of foil so that I could seperate the fish and the potatoes.  I sprayed both with spray butter, placed the potatoes cut side down and sprayed them again with butter then sprinkled with sea salt.  When they were nearly finished, I put the fish in with them, but on the other side of the cookie sheet on their own little foil pan.
