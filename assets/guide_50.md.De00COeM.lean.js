It's not often I find a recipe the whole family loves. This recipe is it. The only changes I made was the oven temp. Instead of 500, I did 450, cooking for 45 min before adding chicken. I also cook the chicken for 30 minutes. (I did these changes due to people complaining about over cooked potatoes and undercooked chicken. These changes make it come out perfect.) Oh, and I used way less pepper. 1 tablespoon is a bit much for me. I use freshly ground and that would be a lot of grinding! Plus, I like pepper, but not that much! ;) I used Frank's hot sauce and it must be more mild then what some reviewers are using. The heat wasn't too much and I was asked by one of my kids to put in more. Everything else remained the same. I served it with blue cheese dressing for the adults, ranch for the kids.

I was thinking this might be nice with tofu instead of the chicken, too.

The seam is on the long edge and means to stick it down as it were. I found the crust on this bread delicious. Next time - another tip from chefy - is to include bread improver or a little bit of vinegar in with the flour. Haven't tried it but he swears it will make it even fluffier!

So I started looking for a recipe to make my own bread.  I made this recipe twice and the only change I made to the recipe was that I cut the salt to one teaspoon instead of three.  Both times this bread had turned out wonderfully!  It is easy to make (I have had my Kitchenaid mixer for 16 years and never tried to make bread before!),  it made beautiful loaves, and tastes really good.  Especially good toasted.  I wrapped one loaf and put it in the freezer for another day.  Thanks for the recipe and for the detailed instructions.

The most signatory characteristic of a baguette is its crusty exterior. That is missing in this recipe. If you wish to make this recipe more authentic, wait a few minutes after putting the dough in the oven, and then use a light sprayer with water (a Windex sprayer will do) and spray the sides of the oven to create steam at 5minute intervals 2-3 times.\\n\\nIf you want an even more authentic taste, do as the French do. Consider using a classic &quot;sponge&quot; as part of your rising agent. You can create a sponge the night before by combining one cup of flour, 1 cup of water and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast in a covered crock or plastic container, left on the cpounter. . Use one cup of the result with the recipe (reducing the recipe by 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 flour)  To keep your very own sponge going, simply replace the flour and water, not the yeast, mix and place it in the fridge.

The dough was dry--baguette dough should be wetter than your average dough. I've seen other recipes that don't require kneading. Instead, the wet dough should have multiple resting periods of about 45 min each, folding the dough a few times in between the resting times. That is what gives the baguette its good flavor. This recipe turned out more like a common white bread loaf that has a very close texture and bland flavor. I baked it at 400 F for 20 minutes with steam added to try to get a nice crust. Since it was so dense and dry, there wasn't much of a crust. The result was just a plain, dense, chewy mess. Also, sesame seeds don't go on french baguettes.

I made this recipe for a ZWT9 challenge to adapt a recipe to vegan, and chose this one because it seemed fairly simple to adapt.  I made it vegan by using vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth, and replaced the sour cream with a greek garlic and potato sauce called skordalia which was leftover from Recipe#503872 (awesome, BTW!). I only used 1/2 tsp cumin, and only 1 tsp of the oil to saute. The result was amazing. The soup is rich and creamy in spite of having virtually no fat other than a tiny bit of oil used to saut&eacute; the leek and garlic. When paired with the skordalia, it was a sensual delight.  The soup is sweet and creamy, and the skordalia is tangy and garlicky.  I kept taking bites with and without skordalia, not able to decide which was better.  I came away knowing that this was the best of all worlds - I really CAN have my cake and eat it too!

This one, though rated 5 stars (God knows why), is awful; a waste of good meat, time and money.

In my town is a guy who had made a small fortune in used cars and real estate, and had always wanted a restaurant; so he bought a local eatery and poured money into it to make it a nice place. However, he has a major jones for thyme.

I'm not giving this any stars but only a warning to anyone who might be out there like me who never made gelatin before. Read the directions on the box.

I made this over the weekend for 8 people, and it turned out stunning (and giant--8 of us got about 2/3 of the way through). It gets better every day it sits, so I'm enjoying eating the leftovers. The espresso in the buttercream is wonderful, and the whipped cream frosting is tasty, but not loaded with sugar, making this a very well-balanced cake. I had to use sweet cherries instead of sour, and brandy instead of kirsch, and I can only imagine how much better it would be with the right ingredients(great for an adult palate, not a sugar bomb!). Here's some tips on what I did. *Plan ahead. The more you space this out, the better. Follow the directions--soak the cherries for at least a day before you make the cake itself (especially if you are making a sub. for the kirsch). Assemble the cake (everything bu tthe whipped cream frosting) at least a day (preferably 2) before to let it soak--it makes a huge difference. *BIGGEST TIP: Someone else had their cake split, and I think I know what happened. Because this is a three layer cake, the layers need to be VERY even, or the center will be higher than the sides, putting stress on the middle of the cake and causing it to split (especially since this soaks in liquid). Make sure you level your cake before layering. Then, make sure you arrange your cherries in an even layer (on the cut side) across the entirety of the cake (all the way to the side)--don't just spread them around willy-nilly to be roughly equal. Someone suggested using a thick line of buttercream at the edges to keep the cherries from squeezing out, but the cherries aren't cooked, and if you arrange them with the cudge edge down, they'll be very sturdy and supportive of the cake. The cherries, not the buttercream, are the support! I had some issue with my second layer, where the sides were starting to droop and crack, and I ended up filling the gap between the two cake layers with extra cherries and the excess cake from the domed tops of each layer, which worked okay. The third layer, i put the cherries in concentric circles all the way out to the edge, and had no issue. *I used Betty Crocker Devils Food cake mix (2). I was making homemade buttercream AND whipped cream frosting, I had no interest in making sponge cake too. It turned out well (but I'd recommend baking a bit longer than recomennded on the box to get it dry enough to absorb all the kirsch). I had fresh sweet cherries available, but next time I would love to try the sour to better balance the cake. *Kirsch was $35, and unless I'm making this weekly (thinking about it, that good), I have no other use for it, so I used plain brandy and pureed some of the extra cherries. Next time, I would take the brandy, add about 5 pureed cherries, and add some pits to soak for a few days to make a more biting substitute. *Like others, I thought the buttercream filling was too sweet. Next time, less sugar, but it was already too thin as in to pipe well. I would chill it next time, then pipe, though. *The whipped cream frosting made the perfect amount with 2 cups of cream--it covered my entire cake, plus about 1 cup extra. Didn't use the dry milk, made no difference."},{"name":"kittencal s beef pot pie","steps":"preheat oven to 375 degrees f', 'prepare a 10-inch deep-dish pie plate or use a medium casserole dish', in a small saucepan cook the cubed potatoes and diced carrots together in boiling water with a teaspoon of salt until the potatoes are just until fork-tender they should cook at the same time , don't worry if the carrots are a bit more firmer drain and set a side, 'heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat', 'add in onion , celery , dried chili flakes saute until soft', 'add in garlic and cook 2 minutes', 'stir in the tomato paste for 1 minute', 'stir in flour , then whisk for 1 minute', 'add in the gravy whisk until thickened', 'add in the worcestershire sauce', 'add in the cooked beef and mushrooms', 'simmer for about 15-20 minutes on top of stove', 'add in the cooked potatoes and carrots', 'mix to combine', 'season with salt if needed', 'pour the mixture into deep-dish pie plate or casserole dish', 'top with pie pastry , leaving about 1-1 / 2 inches all around the dish', 'flute the ends of the pastry all around the dish , then cut a couple of slits on top to let steam escape', 'place on a baking sheet to catch any spills', 'bake for about 40-45 minutes , or until the filling is bubbly and the pastry is browned', 'delicious !'","description":"i always make this pot pie with the left over gravy from my blade pot roast (recipe#151068) if i don't have 2 cups i add in some consomme or beef broth to make up the 2 cups, but you can use any leftover gravy recipe or just use canned consomme or beef broth, but i have to say it's much better using gravy --- this can also be made using a double pastry but i don't bother with that it's just as good, and easier using just one pastry top --- make certain to simmer all the sauce with the cooked beef on top of the stove for about 15-20 minutes, this will improve and intensify the filling mixture --- do not season with salt until just before ready to transfer into the pie dish or casserole, trust me the beef filling is so good you may find that you will have it half eaten before you even get a chance to bake it in the crust and it's also wonderful topped on baked puff pastry shells too --- please do not omit the potatoes and carrots, they add so much to this pot pie --- you will love this!","ingredients":"pie pastry', 'butter', 'onions', 'celery ribs', 'garlic cloves', 'tomato paste', 'dried chili pepper flakes', 'dried thyme', 'flour', 'beef gravy', 'worcestershire sauce', 'cooked beef', 'potatoes', 'carrots', 'sliced mushrooms', 'salt & freshly ground black pepper'","review":"I used Hershey's syrup in place of fudge topping but YUM.
