Please see my rating system, I think that this recipe gets a very well deserved 4 stars for the moment, but I think that it has the potential to be a 5 star recipe so once I have finished with the ZaarTour cooking I will give this a go again with fresh spinach and let you know :)\\nUPDATE: I tried this again with fresh spinach and YUM we like it EVEN BETTER! The flavours came out even more...DH isnt a lemon lover at the best of times and actually likes that using the Zest meant he got lemon flavour without the sourness, and the garlic was subtle, but definitely there. Both DH and our vegetarian guest even said maybe experiment with more garlic? but were also perfectly happy with it as it stands, so a hit all round. My only mistake was thinking that one 700g package of fresh spinach would be enough for the 3 of us it wasnt and in future I will double the recipe.

I let the stock cook down into almost nothing before adding the sour cream and it was still slightly watery so next time I will wait until it is completely reduced before adding the sour cream. The chicken really soaked up the flavors in the sauce and my two-year-old ate more of that than he did the pasta, which never happens.

I was looking and looking for a good moist and sweet cornbread recipe and had the hardest time finding it and ultimately thought I couldn't because I was not looking for a vegan recipe.  3 years ago I needed to make a vegan cornbread for our vegan friends and I came across this recipe.  I have made this over and over and over again- no one can tell it is vegan-- so, it is the cornbread I make for my entire family and all friends whether vegan or not!<br/><br/>You can use cow's milk- when I did I used 2% or Fat free.  But honestly it tastes better with the Soy. I have added frozen corn and even pickled jalapenos and it always turns out great!  I may try reducing the syrup in the future to give it a less sweet and more savory taste- but that may upset all who I make this for :) <br/><br/>I just bought new double ovens and found that 35 minutes is a bit too long in the oven and I actually cooked them last night at 350 for 25 minutes (conventional not convection).  They were very moist and of course very sweet and make a great breakfast the next day!<br/><br/>The reason I post this review now (3 years later) is because last night I lost the printed recipe and went to look for it again online and came across it twice on Food.com (I thought this was funny).  It just has a different name, Moist Vegan Cornbread.  It is the EXACT same recipe and does not give credit to Candace & Amy at the Vegan Lunch Box (which I appreciate this one did).  I also noticed that it has more reviews.  Of course they are mostly all 5 star because this recipe is AWESOME!

Okay, so how did I screw up? Well, I put in a full teaspoon of baking soda (and one could certainly feel it) and half the amount of salt (actually, a VERY GOOD THING...it didn't need the full amount) AND I accidentially used a full teaspoon of vanilla (worst things COULD happen). Please don't ask how this happened. I had two recipes opened at once and...well... Now here are the substitutions I INTENTIONALLY made: Substituted margerine and butter for all all shortening/crisco, more nutmeg and cinnamon (as per my tastes) Whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour and pecans for walnuts (that's what I had on hand...and about 1/3c at that) I feel that the cookies, despite my baking soda disaster came out very fluffy and lovely and with the icing made a STUNNING presentation and kicked the flavor up a notch (and also masked my botched Baking Soda situation). DEFINATELY make this with the icing. I agree with a previous poster when I say that there is no reason over-ripe bananas should be used in some boring bananna bread. Light and lovely texture and flavor. I am freezing my batch (between wax paper) to break out for later in the week or to give as gifts. They seem to hold up to freezing well. Hope the icing does well too. What a LOVELY way to make a cookie! Delightful and BEAUTIFUL to look it.\\n\\nedited to add: These freeze like a dream.

I used McCormick brand Curry powder. I try to stay away from the 99cent spices as they just don't taste as good. The stickiness and texture comes out perfect with the chicken broth (you may need to add water to cook the carrots and potatoes until soft) I highly recommend that you use jasmine rice. If your not good at making rice do this. Add 1 cup rice and 2 cups of water to a pot. Dont rinse it. Turn on the flame, and wait for it to boil, wait 5 minutes, cover and lower the heat to low.

I give it four stars because it really did look so nice.  That said, if I made it again, I would only use parts of the recipe.  The crust was great.  I liked it as a unique thing that made the cake special.  The cake part didn't turn out so well.  I had to cook it about 45 minutes to get it done, then it turned out to be too dense.  I didn't see much difference between the filling and the frosting, so I just made the frosting to use for everything.  Next time, I would not use the oreo crumbs in the cake.  I'd just make a white cake with the cookie crust.  I made this for my daughter's 11th birthday party and got lots of compliments on its appearance.

I liked the additions of cinnamon and parsley to the end product.  I enjoyed for lunch at work.

I followed the ingrediants exactly but changed the procedure to fit my needs for a very busy fall day.  Didn't marinate at all or even brown or sear the pork.  Added all the ingredients for the spices to the bottom of my crock pot, stirred and then added the pork loin fat side up.  Then set the crock pot on low for 6 hours.  Around every 2 hours or so I turned the roast to make sure all sides were drenched in the sauce.  The result was a nicely browned, flavorful and moist pork loin.  The flavors seemed to blend so well and using this method don't think the marinade was even needed prior to cooking but I may try that next time.  Served over Thai noodles and the gravy that was made in the crock pot made for a wonderful flavored sauce.  This will be on our regular menu from now on.  I highly recommend it to anyone.

But I have eaten it different places, so I do consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about this dessert.  I also have an penchant for flan, especially pumpkin or sweet potato flan, and have made either on several occasions.<br/><br/>My first comment is about the caramelization of the sugar.  It is a tricky beast and following this instruction would result in burnt sugar (yuck!).  I did try to do it this way, but I had to take it off the stove before the sugar did burn, so it was not quite syrup; there were quite a bit of crystals still there.  So, my caramelized sugar didn't spread on the bottom of the pan or the sides, but instead, sort of congealed in sections and only on the bottom.  (And I do use a Mexican sugar called Zulka; I like the morena - which is good, because it is the only store I know of in the metro area that sells it!)  My recommendation: caramelize the sugar in the oven in the pan you plan to use.  (Of course, like any sugar, you have to watch it like a hawk!)<br/><br/>I also used less sugar than called for in the recipe - partially because I like to put some sugar in the custard.  So I only used a little more than 1/2 c. sugar for the caramelization...<br/><br/>I only then modified the custard, adding about 1/3 c. sugar.  I don't have pumpkin pie spice, so just put in cinnamon and allspice.  I accidentally put clove in instead of nutmeg and purposely used ginger paste in lieu of powder.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the easy bake (my Velos, which has a convection bake, but does not, I think, reach the correct temperature; I need to calibrate the doggone thing) failed to finish baking in 45 minutes - even though I thought I could not fit about a quarter cup of custard into the glass quiche pan I had used - so I didn't try - and there was therefore less flan to bake which, one would imagine, would have taken less time.<br/><br/>After an additional 30 minutes or so, I took it out, ran a butter knife around the sides, and turned it upside down onto a dinner plate.  It came out a bit lopsided, but it slid right out of the pan with no problem whatsoever (and which is why I always do this right after it came out of the oven).<br/><br/>Gotta say that it was very tasty, and, although a bit eggy tasting, quite delicious (and definitely more flan-like than pumpkin pie-like).

The lovely pink shade also made it perfect for a spring buffet.  Thank you so much for sharing this - I will make it often (it's already been requested for future gatherings).

I visited here to see suggestions on making the dish without roasting the tomatillos first. I digress, this can be a great dish without breaking the bank. To thicken this chili I use xanthan (sometimes called xanthan gum). It takes very little powder, it is clear, shiny and flavorless when fully mixed (and adds no net carbs). With a little practice you will get just the right consistency. To keep it from lumping up mix, first in a separate bowl until smooth, I like to use oil or butter but you can use plain water. I would start off with 1 teaspoon for this recipe and add more (premixed) to achieve the body you like.
