I had to sub boneless skinless breasts because I couldn't find any boneless ones with skin on, and I used achiote paste in place of the powder (I don't keep achiote powder on hand). The marinade smelled so good when the hot oil was added to the paste mixture! I let the chicken hang out in the fridge in the marinade for 2 days, until I had time to actually grill it on my indoor grill (SOMEDAY I'll talk DH into getting us a real grill, lol). The finished chicken came out so juicy and flavorful, but the flavoring was mild enough that any leftover cooked chicken could be used in so many different ways (soups, salads, sandwiches, tacos, etc.). We enjoyed it as-is the first day, with Mexican rice, refried beans and fresh pico de gallo. Now I'm tossing up whether I want to use the leftover chicken to make tacos or chicken salad.

I made this with half green and half purple cabbage to give it nice color.  LIke the others suggested, I doubled the sauce ingredients, mixed the brown sugar with the melted butter and oil, and added the vinegar (I used balsamic) after the cabbage had sauteed for a few minutes.  Instead of canola oil, I used sesame oil, which gave a nice flavor!  I served this with corned beef brisket and the sweet/tangy taste was a nice compliment to offset the saltiness of the corned beef.  Also, one thing i noticed is the cabbage reduces ALOT in size after sauteing for 20 minutes.  My big wearever skillet was full when I started and it reduced to about 1/4 in the skillet when it was fully cooked.  I shred 1/2 each of an average sized green and purple cabbage into larger than bite size pieces and it was enough for the two of us with no leftovers.  Will definitely make this again with the different variations of red wine vinegar and/or onions.  I thought I'd try it also with red cooking wine sometime as well to see how that tastes.

Ever since he said that, when I eat it, I felt like I was eating buttered noodles, to the point where I am convinced this could be a great low-carb pasta substitute for certain sauces.

Right now, I'm on a fat-flush diet (for the first time in my life). At first, I was disappointed to find that cabbage is high on the list of items to eat to attack belly fat. And THEN I found a Chinese Egg Rolls recipe (I used turkey meat) and now THIS recipe. My mouth was watering before this recipe finished cooking!\\n\\nI followed the recipe, except no salt, and then made some substitutions and additions, for personal taste. First, I took another reviewer's advice and added a whole yellow onion, thinly sliced. I had part of a cole-slaw package leftover from the egg rolls that I used with a whole head of shredded green cabbage. I substituted olive oil for the canola, and ended up with about 1/4 cup olive oil, couldn't resist a second tbsp of butter, and 4-5 cloves of garlic in the pan. I also substituted Balsamic Vinegar for the red wine vinegar. I usually use a lot of spices, but on a whim, I was generous with Greek Seasoning as the only seasoning. Also, personally, I like my food spicy, so I added some thin slices of yellow hot peppers. Finally, I didn't want the package of crab meat I had on hand to go to waste, so in the last 2 or 3 minutes of cooking, added that, too. (I threw in the hot peppers at the same time as the crab.) Once the crab and peppers were thrown in, I added a small splash of lemon juice in the last minute of cooking.\\n\\nI could hardly wait to eat by the time this was ready.

I made it on a whim when we had family guests who appreciate Asian cooking. Everyone LOVED it. I really thought that I had made too much, but everyone loved it so much that I ended up only having a small amount to eat myself. I omitted the red pepper flakes, because I have young kids, and my hubby doesn't like spicy dishes. Also, the flank steak I bought was sliced in a big panel, but the panel was very thin, so it was much easier to slice up into thin strips than just regular cut flank. MAKE SURE you do slice them thin - it makes a huge difference in the taste and how the corn starch binds to the meat. For the sugar I used splenda blend, and only 1/4 cup instead of a half - also, I don't actually have a wok, I used a 2-quart pan instead. Although it takes a bit of time, more than 30 minutes prep for me (I'm domestically challenged), it's worth it. Totally, totally worth it.

IT is excellent!!  My kids (age 4 and 6) love the local take out ginger beef. We thought we would do something different for supper tonight to bring in the New Year.  We have made Chinese food before but have never attempted to make our own ginger beef, I thought it was too time comsuming but surprise surprise this is a super easy recipe. The most time consuming is cooking the beef but after that its minutes and its ready. The only thing I would do next time is that I might cut back on the red pepper flakes for the kids, they drank lots of juice with supper but both LOVED the ginger beef. There is one little dish left in the fridge and I am sure by morning my husband will have finished it off.

I really didn't feel like cooking today but I already had the meat defrosted for this recipe so I took a lot of shortcuts and was able to make it in 15 mins (total, not all prep time). I simplified steps 1-4 and simply coated the beef in cornstarch. I had bought the beef already in strips so that saved time too. I let the cornstarch sit on the beef while I pre-heated my deep-fryer and made the sauce. I left out the carrot and used powdered ginger instead of fresh (about 3/4 tbsp) just because I was being lazy. The meat took about 3 minutes in the deep fryer, then I added it to the sauce mixture that I made on the wok while the meat was cooking, and then I added a small amount of cornstarch mixed with water to turn the sauce into a thick sticky glaze. Despite all of my shortcuts, it ended up being a 5 star recipe. The perfect combination of sweet and spicy. It had A LOT of flavor which I liked, but it may be too strong for some people.

I found the ginger to be very spicy as well and there is a lot.  Next time I think I would cut back on the full amount.

When I was a small child my Dad used to make wonderful bread that had this flavor and texture, I keep trying to get him to make it for me, but he can't remember the recipe he used. So, I have been searching for years (almost 40) for bread that tasted like I remember his.

Either I did everything right, or these are fool proof, because they turned out perfectly. For me this made about 20 large rolls. These do have a rich yeasty flavor, but I don't know when that became a bad thing, I guess it's just personal preference, but they were absolutely what I have been craving and looking for for years. I told my husband, next year for Thanksgiving lets just have Cheladas (budweiser's beer and clamato mix, which we love) and these rolls, it would be so much easier!

For us, they were just the right amount of everything.  All the flavors merge together well, texture was perfect.  They actually felt a little heavy coming out of the oven, but I think it was simply because there were so many of them (happy, happy, happy).  I always butter them before serving and the texture was perfect on each of them.  One adult male ate 8 of these with his meal.  I believe that was the record, but the point is YES!  They were THAT good. Thank you for sharing.  We will be serving these on a regular basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am now using this dough for my meat pies and they are even more amazing than they were before!  This is a must for anyone who toys with bread making at home.

I&#039;ve made these several times now and we just love them. However, 2- for instructions. Thank goodness for other bakers on this site.

I have tried other recipes before but they didn&#039;t turn out as well. My family loved these. I agree with the other comments that you should let the dough rise a couple of times. I made the dough then covered it in a bowl with plastic wrap. I went to pick up the kids from school and ran another errand. When I returned I kneaded the dough again, separated the dough and rolled them into balls and put them in a light greased baking dish. I covered the dish with plastic wrap and let rise again while I was cooking the meal. Before putting them in the oven I brushed the top with a little butter and brushed with butter again just before serving.
