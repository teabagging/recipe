Boy, am I glad I made these anyway! I had to make a few substitutions due to pantry availabilities, but the basic spirit of the recipe was still there. I didn't have any lettuce other than iceberg, but I had some fresh baby spinach (I thought that was closer to romaine than the iceberg lettuce), so I used the spinach for my greens. I had some shredded carrot that I needed to use up, so I mixed that into the cream cheese mixture (nice added crunch, and extra veggies never hurt). I had some sundried tomatoes lying around, so I chopped up a few of those and tossed them on. I had roasted yellow pepper instead of red. I was fresh out of shredded mozzarella, but I did have some sliced provolone. The only black olives in the house were kalamata, so in they went. I still have a lot of the ingredients left over since I was the only one eating at the time, so I will have to try Susie D's suggestion of grilling them (I love wrapinis!). My only complaint was that my garlic clove was gigantic (probably equal to two normal cloves), so the spread was a little too sharp garlicky for my tastes.

I have made this 4 times as of last night, and have gave the recipe out to numerous people. The only thing that I do different, is to make my own fresh herb cream cheese mixture instead of the store bought variety. I have a question for those having trouble with the bacon not being cooked enough, are you using the broiler for the last 5-10 minutes? I do, and I don't even pre-cook the bacon like suggested, and the end result is visual and taste perfection. The one thing that I REALLY like about this recipe is that you can refrigerate the left overs and then cut them into 1/4 pinwheels the next day for snacks, to put on top of a salad, or to use as hor dourves. This dish also goes great with a light Bernaise sauce, the distinct flavoring of tarragon, shallots, and chervil just makes it even more mouthwatering!

I decided not to use any butter or salt because I thought that the juices and sodium from the bacon and cheese would be enough.  I was correct and it was very flavorful without it.

And since I LOVE spinach, certainly a recipe I'll happily make again. I increased the garlic to three cloves and added one onion - both of which I minced.  Having several times been surprised - and most disappointed - that onion had not fully cooked in a dish baked in the oven, I sauteed the onion and garlic until just softened.  I then added the other ingredients in step four to the pan, and added a pinch of nutmeg while seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Only then did I transfer the ingredients to the baking dish.  I followed KITTENCAL's recommendation and halved the pasta.  Inspired by dicentra's photographs, I used penne.  I added 2 handfuls of chopped baby spinach leaves (which I always have a plentiful supply of on hand) to the 2 packets of frozen (thoroughly squeezed) spinach.

Ultimately, I just kneaded the atta dough, pinched off equal size balls and re-kneaded these balls with the jaggery mixture and then proceeded to make the round rotis which were a mixture of the atta dough and jaggery mixture. These turned out to be on the less sweet side.

I also used a garlic and roast onion tomato paste and gruyere for the cheese otherwise followed this to the tee.. Ooohhh!!! Yum, Yum and Yum I will be making this again for sure.. I had been catching so many mud crabs and have been eating them plain or just with some garlic butter as I feel it is a sin to spoil such good flavoured crab meat with other flavours.. As I had caught so many I decided to change it up a bit, and this to me was the perfect balance of creating a great crab dish, that did not ruin the natural flavour of the meat..

Use only a quarter of the prescribed bacon; two pounds is a bit much.  When I made this I used a quarter pound and it was plenty.  Bake your bacon on a wire rack as to allow most of the fat to drain away, and cook it crispy.  I added 10 plum tomatoes and seeded them before dicing.  It kept the added moisture under control.  I like green onions, so I used about 1/2 cups worth, or about 6 onions.  I used endive and romaine hearts instead of the crackers or chips.

In response to those who find them dry, I would say that they are right if you are comparing them to cake muffins.  so i that is what you prefer, these are not the muffins for you.  But, if you are a fan of denser muffins, then you should give these a try.  Also, INMHO, the muufin batter is adequately sweet.  The tartness is all in the cranberries.  Next time I''ll cut them in hslf do that the tartness is less concentrated in certain spots.

I used a can of whole canned cranberries. I make banana nut muffins every week, but thought these sounded good so I thought I'd try. Using the canned berries the batter was very loose...I thought too loose so I used an extra 1/2 cup of flour and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. The muffins were in the over at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. The orange flavor was nicely prominent, less so with the cranberries. Given that I was flying by the seat of pants without fresh berries I opted not to add nuts because I hadn't made the recipe before. (I know the recipe didn't call for nuts) However, without fresh berries I felt the muffins would have benefited by adding nuts because of the mouth feel. The other thing I'm not successful with is adding the sugar to the top - I know what it SHOULD look like, but it just melts into the batter - maybe I have to let the muffins set up a bit and add the sugar later during the baking time.

Also used 4 cups of beef broth and two cups of water. Did not add the red pepper flakes because DH doesnt care for them but they would have been a nice addition. Couldnt find barley so I used quick cooking barley and added it after the lentil mixture had simmered 40 minutes. Served over brown rice and I think whole grain pasta would be very nice too.

it was suggested to me by a friend that made it that it wasn't sweet enough for her (although i think that's part of what i like about it) but if you like a sweeter cake you might want to go ahead & do the 2 c of sugar, she used the lesser amount. grandma sometimes put a fudge frosting on it that i didn't really like (the cake itself was my favorite part), often times, she made it with-out frosting which was my favorite way. it has a shiny top to it, & i myself like to dampen a piece of crocheted lace and lay it flat on top once cooled (right before serving) and sprinkle with a sifter, powdered sugar on it, then carefully removed the doily leaving only the beautiful white pattern on top. the other topping i like is whipped topping with chocolate syrup added, it is nice & light with the dense cake. i use a spatula to make pretty peaks as your design. however, if you use whipped topping the cake needs to be eaten and/or refrigerated soon, as the topping will make the cake soggy. i will be trying to add pictures of this cake decorated both ways soon, so check back to see them. any other light creamy frosting of your choice would be good as well, or if you're like me, you'll just eat it plain & call it good lol. i searched as well as i could to try to not duplicate, & while a few recipes are similar, none (that i found) have these ingredients, made in this way, & i personally have never tasted another chocolate cake like this one. i hope you enjoy!","ingredients":"flour', 'sugar', 'baking cocoa', 'salt', 'cold water', 'vegetable oil', 'butter', 'buttermilk', 'eggs', 'baking soda'","review":"This was excellent, I made it twice this week."},{"name":"chocolate leaves   leaves you wanting for more","steps":"break the chocolate into pieces', 'keep aside in a bowl', 'heat water in a pan', 'place the bowl with chocolate in it making sure that water does not spill into the bowl', 'double boil it until the chocolate melts', 'line a tray with grease-proof paper', 'gently dip the back of each bay leaf in the chocolate and place it on the tray with the chocolate side of the leaf on top', 'chill the leaves for 30 minutes and peel off the bay leaves to make yum chocolate leaves'","description":"simply yummy and so very creative!","ingredients":"bay leaves', 'chocolate'","review":"This deserves 5 stars for great flavor.

Not quite what the name a?Tomato Alfredoa? suggests, but a pleasant, veggie-rich sauce thata?s not too bland and not too intense. The idea of first making a super-thick, paste-like sauce then using the juice from the frozen spinach to dilute it is amazingly clever. Ia?ve never liked dumping the nutrient-rich juice down the drain when thawing spinach. I did reduce the amount of butter a bit because half a stick for 4 servings seemed a bit much. I think it could be improved by making it cheesier and using some fresh, chopped tomato or even drained, canned tomato.

I had to double the amount of milk in the beginning as the flour, milk, cream cheese mixture was the consistency of a dough. I also was a little confused in the directions when it said to add frozen spinach. No where previously did I see where it said to thaw the spinach so I put it in frozen, I thought perhaps the added liquid was what was supposed to thin out the sauce. This did not work for me however, because it was taking too long to defrost in the skillet while the other ingredients were beginning to break down. So I took it out and defrosted it in the microwave and then added it back to the sauce. As the directions stated, I added even more additional milk to get more of a sauce.

I only had about 1 1/2 lbs of thighs so I had a bit of sauce left over. I would probably want to increase the sauce mixture if I were going to use 3-4 lbs of chicken.  My suggestion would be to cut down the margarine to 1/2 stick and increase the gravy. Be prepared for a very generic tasting chicken dish. Good, but nothing to wow you over. I think next time I would add mushrooms to the gravy or possibly some sour cream or both!

This is why it is important to stir the salt through after the egg and before the oil. The salt is also good for bringing out the garlic. I tasted the pasta before and after adding the salt and the increase in garlic flavour was fantastic! I used linguine and it worked just fine. I also had a bit of baby spinach left. There wasn't enough for a salad so I stirred it through. Shaved a bit of parmesan over my plate as well. This really didn't taste like a lazy meal, even though it was.

I like it even more than Trisha Yearwood's Hot Corn Dip. Made the dip for hubby to enjoy while watching the Packers play on tv today. Instead of using canned corn, I cooked up a 16-ounce bag of Birds Eye Freshlike Frozen Corn, as it's the best tasting frozen corn ever, and I microwaved it for exactly 6 minutes (at 3 min intervals) in my 900 watt microwave oven. I also used Ro*Tel's Original flavored Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilies. I also like the addition of chili powder and garlic powder. This dip was not overly 'hot' tasting (spice wise), and I loved that about the dip, but be careful when removing your baking dish from the oven, as it was steaming hot. I poured the dip into 2 serving shallow bowls, to cool down the dip a bit. While hubby had one bowl and I had the other, I'm not sure we could say this made 6-8 servings. I would say this would possibly make 4 servings. One more thing, the next time I make this dip, I'm considering on only adding 12-ounces of corn, to make the dip a bit more on the creamy side. Hubby says to leave just as is, but I want to play around with the recipe a bit. Kim, I'll let you know if we liked the dip w/less corn and more on the creamy side. This is a fantastic dip, and one I'll be making often.
