I found the patties very dry.  The flavor was nice, but definitely need a dipping sauce. I had several sauces leftover from other contest recipes and they made a difference. I used 1 seeded jalapeno & would go with more next time  or add just a bit of cayenne to finish the spark.  The breading measurements were a bit off. I had lots left to discard. I had to firmly pack the chicken mixture to form into patties and they were still easy to fall apart while frying.  The next day I served the patties on a bun with a sweet/ hot barbeque sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and sliced onions.  I preferred them this way.

I have usually made it with 400 gms of wholemeal flour and 200 gms of all-purpose flour. With that combination, the 400 ml water is spot on to get a really soft dough. I use my stand mixer for this purpose. The first time I baked this bread, I felt it needed a little more salt. So, now I add another 3/4 tsp and use 1 1/2 tsp of active dried yeast. Sometimes, I even substitute about 100 ml of the water for 100 ml of low fat milk, in which case, I melt the butter in the milk over low heat and add the salt to this too. I always keep the covered bowl with the dough in it in a closed, unlit oven to keep it away from drafts. Leaving the oven light on gives the dough a tiny bit of heat it needs to rise well too. Though you might not want to leave it on for the entire two hours lest you ruin the bulb. For the second rising, I leave the shaped dough in the tray on top of the stove, covered with a damp cloth, while the oven is pre-heating. I would recommend leaving the dough alone for the full 2 hours for the first rising and about 45 mins for the second. This recipe makes excellent loaves as well as rolls. In my oven, I bake rolls (11 - 12) for 25 - 30 mins at 180*C and loaves (02 free-form) at 170*C for 35 - 40 mins. This bread has become a staple in my house now and I make it at least twice a week.

They stayed in their ball form. So they had to be flattened when I rotated the pan (have to with my oven). Which made for a interesting task since they wanted to stick to the spoon I flattened them with. So if you are to make these cookies I recommend forming the balls and flattening them to a cookie shape or you will end up with odd shaped cookies. Tasty odd shaped cookies.

The sauce is pretty similar to mine and that tasted real good. But I am sorry neither of us liked the rolls at all. The only thing different I did was use 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb pork, plus I used the savoy cabbage. First I thought it was a little short on the cooking time but went with it anyways. I had put spare cabbage leaves on top of rolls so they wouldn't burn and then I covered in aluminum foil for about 40 minutes. Then removed the cover and the leaves and basted a couple of times for remaining cooking time. But when we ate them I found the cabbage not quite cooked at the stem ends and there was way too many onions and way too much rice, that it made the rolls very dry with only a taste of those two ingredients. Even with the sauce to dip each bite into , it was just way to dry for us. I don't ever like to waste food but I did not keep all these leftovers. I am so sorry Northern Polar, I have never given a bad review before I don't think. But if you could check just to be sure these are the right amounts of ingredients for the rolls.
