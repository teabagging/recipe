I've made this bread twice now - doubling it each time - and we love it. I replaced the sugar with honey for the first batch but used sugar the second time around. I used applesauce to replace all the butter, oat flour instead of all purpose, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and chocolate chips. The first two loaves were thoroughly enjoyed by all. I froze one of the loaves from the second batch and will share with my husband and mother-in-law when they come this weekend. This recipe will replace the one I've used for many years. The only thing that some people may not like is that it did not rise at all for me. I do not have a problem with that - it was easier to cut - but others will be bothered by no rising........perhaps there needs to be an increase in baking soda"},{"name":"bourbon peach barbecue sauce","steps":"stir all ingredients together in a medium bowl', 'brush evenly onto beef , pork , lamb , or poultry during grilling'","description":"bottled barbecue sauce and peach preserves makes this a very easy sauce.","ingredients":"barbecue sauce', 'peach preserves', 'bourbon', 'ground cloves', 'cayenne pepper'","review":"I made this yesterday and upped the recipe so that I could send it with my son whilst he is on the road with his basketball team. So really this isn't just being reviewed by me who of course kept a couple of slices behind to try.. :) It has been given a 5 star rating from an entire bus load of basketball players and their coaches about 28 people.. This loaf turned out so moist and totally delicious.. I used the yogurt, apple sauce over butter and added all the optional extras along with a little cinnamon.. What a fab banana bread recipe this turned out to be.. The funny thing is I hate banana's and even if they put a slice in a drink I can taste it and send it back but for some reason I love banana bread.  This has gone way up there in my top 5 recipes for banana bread, in fact I would probably say this is my second favourite.. For my son and the team the addition of the chocolate was perfect and I chose to add it for this reason.. If I was just making for myself, I would omit and just make the rest as is, with the added cinnamon.. I too thought it did not rise as much as other banana breads I have made but I do not see why this has been mentioned in other reviews. For me the moist cake and taste alone, which to me is what you are looking for, is so superior, the rising of the cake itself does not matter as it is not like it is flat or anything.. Ok have prattled on but just wanted to get across how much we enjoyed this..

I wish I could give this more than 5 Stars because this was sooooo good! I used one pound of spicy sausage from the Basha's butcher. It was very spicy, which we liked. I didn't have red or yellow peppers, so I used one large green pepper, one medium spanish onion, threw in a few fresh mushrooms and half of a left over fresh tomato. I cooked the sausage, drained the fat and rinsed in water. While the sausage was cooking, I cooked the veggies in a wok skillet. I sauted the garlic in the remaining sausage fat and added the veggies once the onions were translucent. Once that was all mixed up with the sausage and had simmered for a bit, I added a 29 oz can of diced tomatoes and let simmer for about 20 minutes. Then added some parmesan cheese and let simmer a bit more before letting stand for about 10 minutes before serving. I didn't serve it with pasta b/c we had pasta last night, but I think it would go great with that or rice. I served it with Lee Hong's Cucumbers #90816 which was a great compliment to tone down the spicyness of the sausage meal. We also took your advice and shared a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot. Will definitely make this again as it will make a great pasta sauce! It tasted better than Olive Garden's spicy sausage penne! Edited to add: What is great about this recipe is the versatility.  I didn't have the same veggies called for in it, but it still turned out great.

However, I thought the avocado dip was a bit bland, so I jazzed it up by adding a couple garlic cloves to the processor along with some salt.  This did the trick.  I warmed the sauce in the microwave before serving as my husband likes his food hot.  I served the chicken over a bed of couscous, with the sauce on top.  Some chopped tomatoes sprinkled on top would also have been good.

Do NOT use low-fat cream cheese - 2. Philadelphia brand cream cheese is best. 3. ALWAYS use the cream cheese at room temperature!  4. Do the hot water bath baking method for it to turn out even creamier.  Also I am going to be making this again with additional extracts, lemon w/some zest, almond, orange w/some zest, etc.  Who knows I might even toss in some coconut, or chocolate, or maybe even some maple flavorings!

I made it as follows: 4T melted butter, 1.5 Cups almond flour, 1/3-1/2 cup Truvia (depending on your preference for sweetness), and I always add cinnamon to give it that graham cracker taste .

I would recommend just using about 1 cup of water.  The chicken was very moist and tender, but the overall flavor was a bit bland.  I think adding come cinnamon would work well, especially with the fruits.

I have made this 3 or 4 times now and can't believe I forgot to review it. This went together very easily, the clear instructions were really helpful and using a bag to coat the shrimp saves massively on cleanup. I did a LOT of extra shrimp for this the second time, because once they get to the browning stage, it's hard to keep poachers from thieving and eating them clean out of the fry pan and even 6 year old DD liked these at the crunchy fry stage (with her adversion to trying new things that is some feat) THAT would earn this recipe 5 stars on it's own LOL. I didn't have panko becuase it's not sold here as far as I know, so used plain breadcrumbs and no one complained.  In fact they were too busy eating.. DH and I with the sauce and DD without it (another kid hangup).

I used 3/4 cups each of the breading ingredients, but had quite a bit left, so next time I'll probably reduce it to 1/2 cup each.  I think that next time I will also layer it a bit differently, add a bit more cheese and cook it for just a tiny bit longer so the flavors can meld together a bit better.

(5 yums, one for each star!). I halved the recipe for 2 people, and could have served more than 3 with hefty portions.  I was concerned that the shrimp could over-cook between the browning and baking steps, so I did steps 1-7 early and then chilled the shrimp (which made rest of the recipe fairly simple to complete).  I followed the recipe fairly closely, only adding about 1/2 tsp of granulated garlic to the bread crumb mixture, and substituting grated romano for the parmesan. I wasn't sure if the parmesan measurement was to be divided for the dredging and topping, so I put the full amount with the crumbs and used more for the topping. For the sauce I used 2 4 ounce cans of tomato sauce and enough water to rinse the cans, about 1/3 C red wine, and added to that about 2 T refrigerated minced garlic, 2 T dried Italian seasoning, and 1 large button mushroom, minced.  The total volume of the finished sauce was 3C, and all of it was needed.  I cooked at 350 for 18 minutes in my convection oven, probably 20-23 minutes would have heated throughout a little better.  I used 2 1/4C bowtie pasta, cooked barely al dente.  It could have used even a little more pasta, but that would have required more sauce. I served this with garlic bread and steamed aparagus with a roasted garlic butter.

However, I was disappointed to find that after 1 hr. 20 min. even the *smallest* drumstick wasn't cooked through. We were hungry so I ended up finishing them in the microwave. Although the recipe states until done, I think the longer cooking time might be more typical, and it would be nice to know up front. Also, I am fairly sure I had 4 lb. of meat, but I halved the seasoning amounts and it was still far too much. Finally, the recipe doesn't say whether to cook covered or uncovered after brushing with sauce. I went for uncovered, basting several times, since I wanted them to be finger food. I won't be making them again, because the kids didn't think they were as much fun as I thought they would - but I still urge other people to try them, keeping in mind that they might take longer to cook. (3 *, March 20, 2003) Update: I think food.com might be kind of glitchy/inconsistent in posting my reviews to the top, since I had no clue I had made this before until I started to post a review. Let's just say that things went much more smoothly this time. I used my probe thermometer set for 175 and ignored it. I got distracted and forgot to start my potato wedges, so I ended up taking the legs out when they were cooked through then putting them back in with the sauce for 20 more minutes. They were perfect.
