Here are some tips: LENTILS: Use green or brown lentils. Red or yellow varieties will break down into mush. DO soak your lentils or they won&#039;t be quite cooked enough. Even 30 minutes in hot water will make a difference.  RINSE your lentils and jasmine rice to wash off excess starch. This will make the grains more distinct and less mushy in the finished dish. OLIVE OIL: I cut the quantity of olive oil in half to 1/4 cup and still got the desired flavor and texture. This is more than enough to fry the onions and flavor the dish. THE ONIONS will crisp up nicely in 15-20 minutes if the heat is high enough. The key is that the higher your heat, the closer you have to watch the pan and stir things to prevent burning. SEASONING: Like most of you, I doubled the cumin to approx. 2 tsp and it was great. Be generous with the pepper. I used a grinder and pretty much covered the rice and lentils before sauteing. Next time I will try reducing the salt a bit. There is a LOT of salt in this recipe and I suspect it will be just as good with half as much.   FINISHING THE DISH: After 20 minutes on the stove, I opened the lid, tossed the onions back in, then closed the lid and turned off the heat while finishing the rest of the meal. This softened the onions back up a bit, kept greedy hands away from them, and helped the flavors blend back into the dish."},{"name":"ginger glazed nuts","steps":"set oven to 300 degrees', 'in a large skillet over medium heat melt butter', 'add in the brown sugar , fresh ginger , 3 tablespoons water , salt and ginger powder', 'cook until the brown suagr is dissolved', 'remove from heat and add in nuts', 'stir until coated', 'spread the nuts in a lightly oiled baking sheet', 'bake , stirring occasionally for about 25 minutes until golden', 'cool completely'","description":"these are a must over the holidays or at any time. i have made this recipe using a combo of almonds, walnuts and pecans, you can really just about use any kind of nut for this. the nuts are crunchy, sweet with just the perfect amount of ginger taste! i most always double the recipe to make of 8 cups of nuts, i find that 4 cups just go way too fast. if you don't plan on using the nuts right away you can store them in the freezer in a zip-lock freezer bag. if you want to just kick the flavor up a bit, then add in about 1/4 teaspoon cayenne (no more than 1/4 teaspoon!) these nuts are also great used in salads.","ingredients":"butter', 'brown sugar', 'fresh ginger', 'water', 'kosher salt', 'ginger powder', 'nuts'","review":"Good basic recipe of the classic Mujaddara dish. But in my experience, the onions did not turn out crispy. I recently found a recipe in which the [very] thinly sliced onions are sprinkled with a bit of salt and flour, THEN fried for 6-8 minutes; this results in the wonderful crispy sweet onions that takes this dish to the next level. Also, I like to use basmati rice that has been soaked for at least 30 minutes, which produces a fluffy long grain that cooks faster.

When it first came out of the oven I thought I'd really done something wrong because it felt very, very firm to the touch and I thought it would be hard and dry. I let it sit for a day and it didn't seem any better, so I covered it with frosting and voila, the third day it was moist, dense and delicious, the kind of thing you can't resist taking a chunk of every time you pass the pan sitting on the counter. So the moral is to get it frosted right away and let it mellow for a day, then dig in. I used a vegan cream cheese frosting and it was delicious. The caramel frosting above sounds even better. Since shortening is baaaaad stuff, I used non-hydrogenated vegan margarine in the cake. You could also use canola oil.

The texture is different; much silkier than other soft pretzels I've made, I think due to the addition and high quantity of butter in the dough (although there is not a buttery taste to them).  I'm not sure if  the egg yolk wash is necessary, except maybe to give them a browner and shinier look.  Also the salt wash (opposed to just sprinkling course salt on them) seems like too much work for the end result.  I did get 16 pretzels out of the recipe, but they were small (2 1/2 - 3 inches wide) even though I rolled my ropes pencil thin.  I would definitely make 8 larger pretzels next time.  I'm glad I tried this (I like to try Hungarian recipes, as it's part of my heritage) but if I made these again, I would probably skip the egg yolk and salt washes and just sprinkle on coarse salt.  I hope my notes help anyone who tries these.  Thanks for posting! (P.S.

I threaded the chicken onto skewers and broiled as directed.  After the chicken was finished, I drizzled it with the reserved sauce.  I served over a bed of lightly fried cabbage (butter, onion, salt & pepper) with a dipping sauce made from fresh avocados, lime juice, jalapeno, heavy cream, salt and pepper.

Dense however, need not equate to heavy and this didn't. It has a full rich apple spice that is marvelous alone but the butter rum sauce puts it over the moon flavor. I did lessen the sweetness of the recipe by using 1 cup of Splenda with 1/3 cup sugar and that worked beautifully for us and because it was a birthday I used a bundt in place of the sheet pan it was baked with convection @300 degrees for 50 mins and was perfect.

After adding in marinara sauce and cream, this should be brought just to a boil and then lowered to a simmer and covered for about 10 minutes to help the sauce reduce by a third efficiently. I lowered fine mesh colander with pasta and broccoli into boiling water for 3 seconds, allowing me to remove all completely for final draining. This was so good I will experiment with more diet-conscious versions, but if they aren't as good, I guess I'll just have to make an exception! By the way, my photo shows the entire recipe, piled on a 12 x 12 plate -- does that look like just 2 servings to you This amount is what the restaurant calls a small order for 2 (maybe 3) people, but this will feed at least 5 people. I'm more likely to increase the proportion of chicken next time, since I can't eat all that pasta.

I used regular hot dogs and I added my seasonings and sauce right to my pot without mixing them together first. Overall we loved this recipe and I'll make it again for sure.

Since I find that tomato paste can disagree with me, I used an Australian bush tomato spice in place of the tomato paste (this has become a regular substitution for me) as it is very flavoursome and has nothing of the sharpness of tomato paste.

They were so superbly flavorsome and the sauce was delicious: an absolute joy to eat!  I'll be making them again soon, and Im really looking forward to trying them next time with chicken mince.

This is something to try on the tofu skeptics you know. Ever since I made some barbecued tempeh with lemon pepper marinade (ugh, awful!) about 15 yrs ago, my husband has avoided tofu like the plague; however, he ate and enjoyed this dish. I served it in pad thai but ate quite a few pieces straight from the dish, and a few cold from the fridge the next day. Marinade has a wonderful combination of flavors. I wouldn't change a thing about it. The only sub I made was jarred minced ginger for fresh. I did like the smallest pieces best, about 1/2 inch dice, because they really absorbed they marinade and were quite firm, almost meatlike when done. I baked right away in a glass 13x9 dish which worked perfectly. Pressing out the liquid makes a huge difference here.

Looking for new cookies to bake for my husband to take with him on another business trip -- and I am so glad I found this one!  The almond taste was fantastic.  I did learn one thing while baking these... they do need to be at least slightly brown on the bottom for the best results.  I was baking them for the suggested time and they were a little too soft, and the almond extract seemed to leave an aftertaste.  As I increased the cooking time and they became slightly golden on the bottom, the taste improved as the almond flavor got a little toastier, and the texture improved as well -- and, no aftertaste.  I heeded your advice to not bake them too brown, but I would make sure that you do get at least a golden tinge to them for best results.

Definitely must use dryed crumbs for the breading. The rosemary is the one thing that really makes this recipe. Other then that I think 2 lbs. of any lean meat,  any dry crumbs, and any cream soup can be used including ready to serve.  However, you may not need to add milk to a ready to serve soup.

Wow, what a great little pea salad this is. We have mega amounts of peas growing in the summer garden now, and this was so perfect in so many ways I am not sure I can list them all.

I probably ate a bowl even before I served it. (shhh!)
