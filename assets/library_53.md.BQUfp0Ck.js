Because this is a dense cake, it slices up into layers beautifully which can be filled with fruit/cream/frosting, etc.  My favorite is just white buttercream :)"},{"name":"skinny penne alla vodka sauce","steps":"in a blender or food processor , puree half the canned tomatoes until smooth', 'chop the remaining tomatoes into inch pieces , discarding the cores', 'in a large saucepan over medium heat , heat the olive oil', 'add the onions and tomato paste and cook until the onions are light golden , about 2 minutes', 'stir occasionally', 'add the garlic and pepper flakes and cook for about 30 seconds', 'stir in the pureed and chopped tomatoes and add the salt', 'remove pan from heat and mix in the vodka', 'return the pan to medium heat and simmer , stirring often , until the alcohol flavor is cooked off , about 8 minutes', 'lower the heat if the simmering becomes too vigorous', 'stir in the milk and cook about 1 minute more until hot', 'in the meantime , in a large pot , cook pasta according to the directions on the package', 'make sure to cook al dente , not over cooked', 'drain', 'return the drained pasta to the pot , add the cooked sauce , and mix until combined', 'cook over medium heat until the pasta absorbs some of the sauce', 'plate each serving and top with 1 tablespoon of cheese and a little basil'","description":"this restaurant quality pasta dish is absolutely delicious.  the luscious, creamy, tomatoey vodka sauce is rich, slightly spicy, with just a zing of vodka.  penne alla vodka became quite popular in the late 80‚Äòs and is still popular today?normally it includes real cream for richness but i'm using reduced-fat milk.  great news though, it still retains the decadent flavor of a regular recipe but with a fraction of the fat and calories.  in addition, i've placed it over fiber rich whole wheat penne instead of white pasta.  the key to this sauce is using a premium vodka? it adds a clean, fresh taste.   a less expensive brand will give a harsh taste. this skinny pasta dish has only 347 calories, and 7 grams of fat compared to sbarro‚Äôs penne alla vodka at 640 calories and 28 grams of fat.  hope you try it soon.  it‚Äôs simply delicioso?,whole tomatoes'","ingredients":"'extra virgin olive oil'","review":"This was very tender and good.

Important things to remember about bread-making: knead it well, especially whole wheat, to develop the gluten. Allow to rise for the full amount of time or until doubled, DON'T rush it! Throw ice cubes in the oven immediately after placing the bread in to form a great crust, and DO NOT open the oven for at least 10 minutes when first baking to ensure proper rise and baking.

I used to make blintzes years ago and loved them but although this recipe was quite different, its filling sounded similar, so I thought Id give it a try.  I can see why Kaarin found the recipe confusing.  I followed what she did and added the lemon zest and juice to the cheese mixture.  I also liked the idea of doubling the lemon, so like her I used more lemon.  I did this also because the recipe I had I remember did have lemon juice in the cheese filling.  From here, I improvised a bit.  The recipe I used to make you could make in a savoury or a sweet version; so adding something like salmon and dill for savoury and fruit for sweet.  I made a sweet Blintz Brunch Bake.  I added a mashed banana and about 8 ounces of blueberries and a tablespoon of honey.

I had one small issue with it: up until the moment I used the thickener, it was fantastic in flavor. I just didn't care much for the mesa flour taste after thickening, though. The sauce was still outstanding but I think that this might be an acquired Texas taste, so next time, I plan to just let it cook and thicken a bit longer, or, use some mild taco or fajita seasoning (Stir-ins brand maybe) as thickener. Still, it's hard to find a sauce that's this great. I think that anyone who skips the chuck steak ingredient and home grinding, and who opts to use regular burger or ground round instead, will be disappointed. I just ground up (pulsed) my trimmed chuck steak in the food processor and it was super-easy. Not a big deal. Thanks for posting this recipe, Kim.

However, there are a couple of problems I had; Mainly, the cooking time. If you're going to use diced steak (Which you should!), it needs to cook WAY longer than 30 minutes. More like two hours, possible three. The thing about JCI's chili is that it's made with cubed meat that's been cooked until it falls apart, but there's still a bigger chunk here or there. 30 minutes simply doesn't cut it for that. The only other problem I had was the masa flour; It makes it taste a little strange, as mentioned in another review.

I was a little low on cheese.  So, I threw a slice of processed cheese in to make it a little cheeser.  I also added about a tsp of salt.  We like things salty in this household.  I also used the garlic and butter crescent rolls... yummy.  I used reduced fat cream of chicken soup. The chicken was leftover from tacos last night.  It was shreded and had cooked all day on low in the crock pot the day before with cream of chicken soup and a can of rotel.  I'm sure that this recipe would be delicious with plain chicken.  This was just what I had to use up.  I tend to like chicken fillings shredded.  Also, I had to cover the dish with foil towards the end of the baking time to prevent the top from burning.

My husband and I used to go to Red Lobster to eat it and now we make it at home about every 1-2 weeks. Very good. Lobster is expensive but still very good on the pizza, so I have made it with chicken too. One pizza I made with Frank's Buffalo sauce mixed with cooked chicken and the other with Kraft Original BBQ sauce. I like the buffalo chicken the best. If you don't have fresh basil,use dried basil, the fresh basil really makes the pizza. For chicken instead, I baked one piece of boneless chicken breast in a glass pan, lightly sprayed with cooking spray, and drizzled a little bit of buffalo wing sauce on it, Bake on 400 for 15-20 minutes, cut open see if cooked throughly, then I shredded and pulled apart the chicken with my hands and then pour the buffalo sauce over the chicken and mix with hands, add the amount of sauce to your liking, I normally make it pretty pink so that I can taste the buffalo sauce. Now you can proceed with making the pizza as normal. Also I did not have garlic butter, so just use regular butter melted with garlic powder, make sure to brush edge to edge. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil for brushing the bottom of the cooking stone and make sure to let the stone preheat.While the stone is preheating, make the pizza and refrigerate.

If one is following current canning guidelines, one should follow these steps:<br/>Fill quickly with the hot jelly mixture, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Wipe the sealing surface of the jars with a clean paper towel, dampened with hot water, to remove any jelly, jam or sugar crystals. Adjust lids.<br/>Work quickly to insure that the filled jars stay as hot as possible until all are filled and ready to load into the canner for processing. However, remember the jam or jelly mixture is very hot and take precautions not to burn yourself.<br/><br/>Load the filled jars, fitted with lids, into the canner one at a time, using a jar lifter. Keep the jar upright at all times. Tilting the jar could cause the hot jelly or jam mixture to spill into the sealing area of the lid, which should remain clean and undisturbed. The water in the canner can be close to boiling when the jars are added, if you have made sure the filled product has remained very hot until the canner load is ready.<br/><br/>Turn the heat under the canner to its highest setting, cover the canner with its lid and heat until the water boils vigorously. Process the jars for 5 minutes after the water boils. The water level in the canner should be 1-2 inches above the tops of the jars.
