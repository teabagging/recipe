Also I use a bit more garlic. As Evelyn says, you can't over cook these, well, I love them really browned so I actually cook them longer.  Right now I actually added almost twice the garlic and haven't turned them yet after over an hour in the oven because they are just now beginning to get the nice golden brown crust.

I also had some chicken stock in the fridge I needed to use, so I used that in place of water, and I really think it bumped them up a notch in deliciousness. When I turned the potatoes over, I added a light dusting of sea salt, but didn't go crazy with it, since I used the chicken stock. Just one note: in my oven, to get them to even start browning, I had to increase the heat to 450 degrees. Both to decrease cooking time and for my own preference, I quartered the potatoes instead of cutting them into wedges. Oh, and I used red potatoes, skin on, because that's how I like it. =) All of my ingredients were organic, which I truly believe the quality of the parts had a lot to do with how excellent this dish turned out.

I used sprouted buckwheat flour.  Made one batch as written and another batch with millet instead of quinoa flour.  Both turned out great.

I subbed more cornflour for the quinoa flour as I just didn't have any.  The wholegrain buckwheat flour made for a very dark and grainy looking pancake, but very healthy and so tasty with the cinnamon.  I find vegan pancakes generally don't rise all that much as it is, but to help the process a bit I added about a tsp of vinegar to the soy milk, I think that helped a little.  But even though they don't rise a lot, they are not dense or overly chewy.  I also made sure to cover the pan with a lid while they were cooking - read somewhere that helps to make them rise.

She said her hubby and inlaws raved about it, so I had to give it a try. I like the fact that I could prepare it so quickly in my microwave, instead of in the oven. The recipe states to cook the sauce for 5 minutes on high, stir, and then cook for 3 minutes more. I cooked mine for a total of 10 minutes; stirring after the first 5 minutes. When making the dumplings, I added a 1/2 cup of milk, w/the 1/3 cup, I found the dumplings were too dry. I did not sprinkle on the entire amount of the cinnamon and sugar. I only used (about) 3/4's of it. I too think the sauce would be great served on pound cake, along w/some whipped cream. BTW, I wanted y'all to know, I cooked this in an 800 watt microwave oven.

If you like fruity desserts, this is a true treat.  The market had overripe mangoes on sale and they were so sweet I only added 1 tablespoon of sugar.  The mango pudding was smooth and silky with a little zing provided by the ginger and lemon.  The bananas created a nice contrast in texture while building on the smooth fruity flavor.  My one big change was using a pre-made graham cracker crust.  It was just too hot to bake right now. The filling was good enough that I could have skipped the crust altogether and made some great parfaits.

It is so easy and so good! Every tropical-fruit fan to whom I've served it has loved it. Two changes: 1) I use a pre-made graham cracker crust, and 2) instead of mango nectar, I puree enough (thawed) frozen mango chunks to make the amount called for in the recipe.

As the garlic is roasted, it is very mellow in the finished product.  That could be a good thing all depending on what it's going with.  For my tastes I think an extra raw clove might be a good addition.  I wish I had had an extra head of garlic on hand to roast alongside the eggplant, and added that in to the mix.  I'm not sure how much I like the mint addition, and I usually love mint - maybe the sort I used wasn't quite right.
