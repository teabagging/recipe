Cut vertical parchment paper liners for sides, fringe the bottom edge to allow flat lining which conforms to the round pan sides and creates the flanges on which the bottom liner rests.

Then press parchment as smoothly as possible to contain the entire sides and bottom,  eliminating the need to grease the pans.

Also, the next morning, pull out the serving plate and dry  the receiving surface should it condense. Prepare serving plate for presentation to the point where you can place the cake onto it in its final position before decorating.  After thorough chilling, your cake should be firm enough that you should be able to release the side clamp just enough to remove the bottom of pan. Close the clamp again. Tilt up the bottom to face you holding cake and sides at angle.  Raise the parchment &quot;fringe&quot;  tabs around the perimeter, and GENTLY peel off the circular bottom liner.

January 31, 2008 -- The combination of grape tomatoes and orzo was delicious -- the little grape tomatoes are so sweet and add a wonderful taste to this dish. I've always loved tilapia, and it was so good with the lemon juice and capers! We don't cook with wine, so I substituted white grape juice.

Still fantastic! Into my *KEEPERS COOKBOOK* it goes! 3-20-08 This is a MUST make recipe! I adore chicken picatta so when I saw [*Tilapia* Picatta I HAD to try it! I love seafood and Tilapia is one of my favorite types of fish!  Tilapia is a very easy fish to cook as it is almost impossible to overcook. Perfect for those who have never cooked fish or are afraid of cooking it. After cooking the required time as listed the fish was perfectly cooked. I wanted to get more of a browned effect though. So in order to acheive that I sprayed some butter flavored cooking spray on top of the fish and popped it under the broiler for a few minutes. The fish did not overcook at all and it resulted in crispy edged fish with a nicely browned top. MMMM! I can never find orzo here so I used some Basmati rice instead. Worked perfectly. The fresh grape tomatoes added such a lovely sweetness and the fresh parsley put it over the top! So delicious! The lemon and wine caper sauce was a perfect finishing touch and really added a fantastic flavor. The sauce comes together very quickly which is another plus. I used a white zinfandel for the sauce and didnt have any fresh lemons so I had to use bottled juice. Still came out beautifully. Kim this recipe is fantastic! Thank you so much for sharing it! It is definitely one of my TOP recipes from now on and will be repeatedly made here! Going into my Fins and Scales (fish) cookbook as well as my KEEPERS cookbook! Congrats on a winner hun!

I went ahead and did the 1/2 cup butter, as I was cooking 3 very large thighs and legs. Next time, I will definitely decrease it.

And she's not that crazy about chicken. We used chicken quarters and cut them up into 4 thighs and 4 legs. Left the skin on. The pieces were large and barely fit into 1 8x13 glass baking dish. I used only about 1/3 cup of butter and I think it might have been too much still because the chicken was soggy on the bottom side when done cooking. I had to increase the cooking time 5 minutes after turning because the pieces were so big. They turned out really juicy and cooked all the way thru. The top was not as crispy as I would have liked. Probably because the pieces were so big and too much butter. Smaller pieces would probably work better. I also added other spices like onion and garlic powder because that's what I always put on all my chicken. Was definitely tender and juicy. 4 stars for an easy and quick recipe. Update: I tried using a metal baking dish instead and tried not to overcrowd the chicken and it turned out MUCH like it was supposed to. Therefore, I've raised my review to 5 stars from 4.

I was skeptical about how they would work and totally expected them to need coaxing out of the containers. I just trusted the recipe, put them in for 3 minutes, quickly took them out when done, turned them over on a large plate,  and magic -  I lifted off the baking container and there sat a steaming hot wonderful muffin! <br/>Just a few notes: <br/>1.  I really appreciated that Emily told me how much banana I should have once I mashed it. Today when I did it, my bananas were so small that it actually took two bananas to make 1/2 cup. <br/>2.  The containers are VERY hot when they are done. Either make sure you have protection for your hands when removing from the microwave & lifting off the plate, OR you can bake them in a large coffee cup and the handle serves as an easy way to take them out and flip them over without burning yourself.<br/>3.  Immediately after you dump the muffin out of the baking container, put hot water in the container to soak. Clean up is a breeze when you do this. If you leave the container to clean up later in the day and have not soaked it, it is much harder.<br/>Give these Magic Microwave Muffins a try. I made them without any sugar or sweetner and they were great. My favorite is to add just a sprinkle of raisins to the top before baking!
