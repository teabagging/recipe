Seasoning salt repeats ingredients already in the coating mix (salt, garlic, thyme, pepper). Garlic salt, rather than garlic and salt, limits the cook's control of the amount of garlic and of sodium. While a rich layering of flavors can make a fabulous peanut sauce, this combination doesn't quite have that subtlety. Perhaps using chili and garlic, adding vinegar is the acidity is needed, would allow more control. Also, to my taste, the hoisin and lime are sweet enough on their own. To my taste there is also a disconnect between the european-styles herbs (rosemary/thyme) in the coating, and the east asian-style (soy/chili/citrus) sauce. As far as the directions, I also found that 15 minutes in the oven was plenty to cook the thin chicken strips. I was not able to mix the sauce by shaking, I just stirred them ingredients together. I was using natural peanut butter, perhaps the recipe was written for a lighter product with oil added.

I enjoyed both the chicken and the sauce separately, but didn't find the flavors of the chicken coating to go well with the peanut sauce, it may have been the choice of herbs, not sure, but something wasn't making it a great combo for me. The coating on the chicken was very good on it's own, as was the peanut sauce. However, the recipe didn't state what consistency the sauce should have been, and after following the recipe, I had a very thick sauce, more like a paste, and had to add much more water.

We also liked that it was nice and crispy with no added oil. I made the sauce for me (since DH isn't a big peanut sauce fan) and thought it was great too. I used only one teaspoon of sugar, half of the sesame oil, and subbed sweet chili sauce and two cloves of garlic. I thought it had a rich balanced flavor, and lived up to its thickness in it's title dipping sauce. I also really liked it over the brown rice and broccolini we had with the chicken. I  made my own seasoning salt, using only a pinch of salt with turmeric, celery seed, onion powder and Italian seasoning. I think the baking time will vary with how thick you cut the chicken strips. Ours were pretty thin, so 15-20 minutes was plenty of time in the oven. The only thing that confused me on this recipe is in the description where it says crispy rice cereal flakes. It made me wonder if the cereal should be like Rice Krispies or like Special K. I went with Rice Krispies, since that was one of the required ingredients for RSC. Serving size is spot on.

The chicken was good by itself too, but I&#039;m not convinced the seasoning in the coating paired with the sauce. I didn&#039;t have any rosemary so left it out. Next time I will also leave out the thyme - I like thyme but the flavor of it was incongruous with the peanut sauce. (I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.) The technique for the chicken was great (love the way the coating snap crackle popped LOL), but I only baked for 15 minutes which was plenty of time to cook the chicken and get the coating crispy - 30 minutes would have been way too long. I used 2lbs. of chicken tenders and the amounts of everything else were perfect for that quantity.

I used salt seasoned with tabasco as well as hickory smoked salt for a little smokey taste.  (plus some plain white salt, b/c I think it needs more than the 1/4 tsp called for in the recipe).  I blanched the garlic so it wouldn't be too overpowering.  I processed the garlic, salts, pepper, oil, and lime juice first, to pulverize.  Then I added the beans in batches so they ground up uniformly.  Then I  stirred the basil leaves into the bean mixture and pulsed it so they wouldn't get too fine - I wanted to really have chunks of basil left so we could taste them.

Growing up, whenever we had chicken it was Shake &#039;n Bake, so I vowed never to buy a box of overpriced spices and crumbs.  With this recipe I kept my vow but also enjoyed this great weeknight.  I used Kellogg&#039;s cornflake crumbs so I could be sure how fine or coarse the crumb should be (1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp. is 2.5 oz. or 70 g, in case I plan to pulverize corn flakes myself).  For my first time, I dipped the chicken in water, then pressed the chicken against the crumb mixture in a plastic bag to apply as much coating as possible.  After over 45 years, I cannot say whether this tasted just like Shake &#039;n Bake, although I suspect it would taste closer had I dipped the chicken in vegetable oil instead of water.

Here are some tips i used based on other reviews (and a few ideas of my own) that made this recipe come out perfectly!  FIRST, use a 4 cup measuring cup.  They&#039;re cheap and easy to find at any grocery store.  Put the lemon juice and about half a cup of water in the measuring cup.  This will keep your apples from turning brown if you go slow.  SECOND, cut the apples very small.  I cut them so they were a little smaller than a pencil eraser.  So, they were roughly 3/16 to 1/4 inch cubes.  THIRD, bring the apples, water, lemon juice, and pectin to a boil.  Boil for about 2 minutes before moving on.  FOURTH, after adding the sugar and brown sugar, bring it to a boil and let it cook for 6-7 minutes.  FIFTH, when you&#039;re ready to pour it into your hot jars, wait 3 minutes.

(Though I would give it a 4.5 if I could.)  First, if you want to make a whole recipe, I would highly recommend getting out two very large bowls and dividing the mix ingredients evenly (4.5 c flour, 3 t baking powder, etc.) into each bowl.  I have some very, very big bowls, and even the biggest couldn't readily accommodate this recipe and still mix the ingredients, so I endured a long process of mixing in three different bowls to ensure everything got thoroughly mixed once I realized the bowl I started with just wasn't going to be big enough.  Second, spreading was difficult, so I ended up spraying my spatula to keep it from sticking while I was spreading the batter.  Third, this was quite sweet- I think next time I will make a smaller batch and try reducing the sugar. Fourth, mine tasted a bit egg-y, which I can't stand.  I'm not sure why, as it didn't seem like more eggs than I would put into an equivalent amount of boxed brownie mix.  The texture of these brownies is spot-on, though.

However we had some issues with this.  It didn't seem to want to cook through.  After the hour I took it out and checked it and it was practically raw except on top, so I put it back in and kept checking it after about 15 minutes.  It ended up taking an additional 45 minutes or so and really could have gone longer but we were tired of waiting.  There were still undercooked (pink) sections in the center.  It also produced a LOT of liquid.  Partway through the first hour is when I noticed it and not having made too many meatloaves I wasn't sure it if was normal or not so I started suctioning some out.  By the time we took it out after the extended time I must have suctioned out 4-5 cups of liquid if not more and the meatloaf itself was still nice and moist so it was definately not needed lol.  I am not sure if it was because our meat was semi frozen in spots still or what, so I won't fault the recipe for that.  I really am not sure why we had so many cooking issues, but in the end we were able to mostly salvage it and as I said before the taste was worth the effort.

The outcome was finger-licking Delicious, but I used way more curry powder. You could smell the curry but hardly taste it, and I was wanting the mild taste anyway for my toddlers and hubby (maybe b/c I didn't use the MrCurry brand). I used ground ginger since I had it and light coconut juice to make it even healthier; worked wonderfully. Most importantly: you will need to increase the length of time to cook the chicken! Unless you want raw curry chicken. I kept taking a piece out and slicing it to see if it was done inside and it wasnt. So i cooked it in the pan for another 10 min or so, and it still wasnt done b/c of the sauce i guess. So i put a lid on it and simmered for about 25 more minutes. Finally, done just right. Next time I plan to cook the chicken all the way before adding the sauce. I imagine it would taste exactly the same. 5* on taste, 4* for the confusion in the directions.

The dough was impossible to spoon on a cookie sheet, it wasn't liquid a bit and I had to shape them with my hands. Be careful when adding the flour. 2) Probably because the flour was too much, baking them for 10 minutes was too much too. My cookies burned a little.

I thought it was quite good.  I used pork tenderloin instead of pork loin.  Unfortunately I did not have orange rind on hand so I had to do without.  I will definitely add it next time as, although this was good, it was slightly bland as it was.  I will also try to use real maple syrup next time to see if it comes out even more flavorful.  I was wary of pork tenderloin because it kept coming out SO salty.  But this was not salty at all - I figured putting a sufficiently sugary coating on it might help.  I wish the maple flavor was more throughout the whole pork.  Maybe next time I will marinate it or heat up leftover sauce to dip into.  One last thing:  For creating a tender pork, I've had better luck in the past by roasting tenderloin at 400 for 40 minutes rather than at 325.  I used just a regular pork tenderloin this time and it took me 1 hr 10 min on 325.  But maybe with the brushing, it needs to cook longer to baste it more.  Also, cooking it at a high heat for some of it might brown the outside some more.  I'lle experiment and re-comment if I come up with some better answers.
