I made mine with shortening and the first time had some problems with the recipe.  The dough was rather hard and not terribly pliable.  Eventually I turned the dough and filling into a bar cookie and served it warm with a dollop of frozen non fat vanilla yogurt.  It was so delicious and flavorful, I had to try again. After checking in with the posting chef, decided that it may have had something to do with the flour and the age of the recipe. (That's why pastry folks use weights not measures.)  The second time I added all the ingredients except the flour and then measured that in 1/4 cup at a time alternating between whole wheat and all purpose flour. Eventually, the dough reached a perfect stage of firmness and softness at 1 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour. At that point I had to incorporate the last bit of flour by hand as the ball was to firm for my hand mixer. Chilled the dough was very easy to handle.  Firm enough to roll, cut and fold but soft enough to yield a tender cookie.  The cookies were perfectly baked at 14 minutes and well worth the effort.  I was a little short on figs the second time so half were figs only and the other half a mix of figs and seedles raspberry preserves.  The combination was awesome and I'm already contemplating other fruit fillings for the future.  Would probably skip that last two tablespoons of flour next time, but will otherwise joyfully make these again.

They are like a cross between a fig newton and a nutra grain bar.<br/><br/>If you haven't baked with whole wheat flour before, it makes recipes a lot drier than regular flour, and the dough can be a little crumbly.  I skimped a little on the flour in the recipe knowing it would be added when I was rolling out the dough.  I think this helped it stay together while I was assembling the bars.  Instead of rolling out a big sheet and cutting it into strips, I divided the dough and rolled the strips individually.  This made it easier to rotate and flip so that it didn't stick to my rolling mat.  <br/><br/>I found the amount of fig filling to be just right, but if you want more than just a hint of fig in the middle, perhaps you should increase the filling like another comment suggested.<br/><br/>The only modification I would make to this recipe next time would be to cut the brown sugar.  3/4 of a cup would be plenty."},{"name":"peppers and steak for crock pot","steps":"cut steak into serving size portions', 'place 1 / 2 the steak in crock pot', 'arrange green peppers on steak', 'place remaining steak on top', 'mix remaining ingredients together and pour over meat', 'cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or high 4-5 hours serve over white rice'","description":"","ingredients":"lean round steak', 'green peppers', 'dried onion', 'beef bouillon', 'soy sauce', 'ground ginger', 'garlic powder'","review":"very good!

What goes into the real thing can't always be included in bottles, like cilantro.  The idea of using scallions instead of plain onion is interesting, but don't make people think the humble onion won't do, because it will.\\n\\nMy only criticism is that soy sauce is never an ingredient in Mexican salsa.  I don't know where anyone got the notion to put it in at all.  I wouldn't, and I live in Mexico.  That ingredient's a head-scratcher.\\n\\nOh, and where's the GARLIC\\n\\nThere are some modifications I'd make.  One is to use all fresh tomatoes.  Another is to omit the vinegar and increase the lime juice - and always fresh, never bottled.  The chiles used can be any kind, tho I think serranos are the original.  I use pickled jalapenos because of their lovely flavor, instead of just being chiloso.  It's the taste I want, not the lava!\\n\\nSugar is a good idea, because it retards bitterness, but I think 1/4 tsp ought to do it.  I never put it in salsa, but I do in other things, if they have cucumbers, bell peppers or mushrooms, for instance.\\n\\nAs for quantities, they can be entirely to personal preference, as well as the sizes they're cut into.  Just don't add too much chiloso without considering who will be eating it!\\n\\nPace's sauce is good - for bottled.  But they can't put cilantro in it, and THAT is one of the main sources of taste.  Always use fresh veggies and herbs.  This dish isn't just tasty, it's supposed to be VERY aromatic.  Bottling always removes this attribute.\\n\\nAnd, of course, salsa is always accompanied by genuine tostadas.  Not Nachos or Fritos.\\n\\nTo a good picante sauce, you need only add some avocado and presto:  Guacamole!"},{"name":"peppers stuffed with chorizo and rice","steps":"in a medium saucepan , heat oil and chorizo , cook for 3 minutes', 'add bell pepper , jalapeno , onions and garlic', 'cook until they begin to soften then add rice and cook until all the grains of the rice are coated with oil and the rice begins to take on a little color', 'add all liquids and stir over high heat for 3 minutes , cover and reduce heat to low', 'preheat oven to 400 degrees f', 'place poblano chiles on baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes', 'remove from oven and let cool', 'once cool , cut top 1 / 4 of chile off and remove ribs and seeds', 'do not remove skin as it will help to hold the pepper together', 'when rice is finished cooking , fluff with fork and stir in shrimp', 'stuff chiles with 1 / 6 of the rice mixture', 'place all the chiles on baking sheet and place into oven for 10 minutes', 'remove from oven , mix cheeses together and cover pepper with cheese', 'broil for 3 minutes to melt and brown the cheese', 'serve'","description":"dh hates anything green! but he caught me watching food network (instead of doing housework! lol) and said wow- that looks amazing! this was the recipe, but of course i have tweeked it a little! they used whole poblanos which would be great. please feel free to choose whichever you would like poblanos or bell peppers.","ingredients":"oil', 'chorizo sausage', 'green bell pepper', 'jalapeno', 'red onion', 'garlic', 'rice', 'low sodium chicken broth', 'white wine', 'water', 'bell peppers', 'shrimp', 'colby-monterey jack cheese'","review":"This was awesome!

They were wonderful (or so I was told).  \\nI used leg quarters (thigh/leg combo) for the chicken folk.  I had 4 large quarters, so I used a full sauce recipe.  I cooked the chicken for about 2 1/2 hours.  The sauce on the chicken was very thin, so it did not give the chicken a lot of flavor.

I made them with beef back ribs, doubling the sauce recipe.  I read all the reviews and opted not to use white sugar and added some vinegar instead.  I'm glad I did because even without the sugar and adding vinegar, the sauce was a tad sweet. It would have been way too sweet for us had I added the white sugar.  Also, like others said, the amount of honey was unclear. I used 2 cups (16 oz) of honey so  maybe that is why the sauce was a tad sweet.  I don't know if it was oz by volume or weight. With some tweaking, I can adjust next time for our own tastes.  I didn't have any store bought bbq sauce on hand, so I made TBG's Bobbie Q sauce (#59772). Read my review of that as I accidently used too much cayenne, but it's definitely great if you don't have bbq sauce on hand and it's quick to make.  I didn't add the chili powder as I OD'd on cayenne for the BBQ sauce.  Turns out, I could have added some as it could have toned down the sweetness.  The sauce still had quite the zap and dh really liked it.  Will definitely make this again.  I covered with foil and baked in a deep roasting pan at 325 for 2.5 hours turning and basting a couple times.  When I took out of the oven, I let them sit for about 30 minutes for the sauce to thicken and also skimmed off the fat.  It certainly was not a rub or paste like the recipe implied.  But that's ok because I really like sauce and served this with white rice and doused the rice in the yummy sauce.

Following a number of reviewers' suggestions, I made the following variations to the recipe; it was super easy overall and great for company. I will definitely make this again. \\n1) I love garlic so I roasted 3 heads of garlic and added that to the sauce. 2) I substituted cayenne for the pepper, omitted the white sugar (resulting sauce was still sweet, maybe just a little sweeter than I prefer), used KC Masterpiece Spicy Original BBQ sauce, and added 1/4 cup cider vinegar, 6 dashes each tabasco and worchestershire sauce, and a squeeze or two of fresh lemon juice. I had plenty of sauce for 4 1/2 lbs of pork back spareribs. 3) I got it all ready the night before and marinated it in the fridge covered in foil -- then just popped it in the oven. I cooked it at 325 for 3 hours, then turned the oven off until eating time (maybe 45 minutes later), when I took off the foil and broiled the ribs a few minutes on each side. Next time I might bake it with the foil off a few minutes before broiling to thicken the sauce (it thickened after cooling a bit, but we had eaten all the ribs by then!). 4.

Yum!  We are from the midwest so we like sticky sweet ribs.  This is my first time making ribs of any kind and this was so easy!  I made a few changes.  Omit the celery salt unless you really really like the taste of it.  The Old Bay already has enough celery salt in it.  Being a garlic lover, I used 2 teaspoons of garlic powder and also used 6 cloves of fresh garlic which I threw in the food processor with the fresh onion.  Pour the processed onion into a wire mesh strainer and let the excess liquid drain for a few minutes (give it a little shake every so often to help it along) before putting the onion in the sauce.  I did not have any onion powder but it still tasted great without it.  I put one tsp of pepper instead of 1/4 because we like a little more kick to the sauce.  I used KC Masterpiece Original sauce and actually only used about half of an 18oz bottle.  I also omitted the white sugar.  It came out sweet enough without it.  The sauce was more liquid than described in the recipe so I added about a 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch to help thicken it up.    I used a slab and a half of baby back and cut the slabs into quarter pieces instead of individual pieces and put them in a disposable roaster.  After pouring the well mixed sauce over the ribs, I rubbed the sauce all over the quarter slabs with my hands.  I cooked the ribs at 275 (convection oven) for 3 hrs uncovering them for the last 30 min which thickened the sauce up more.  The meat was tender but not falling off the bone as much as we like so next time I will try cooking at 250.  You should definitely try this recipe.

I made them exactly as written with Jim Beam BBQ sauce.  I removed the foil covering after about 45 minutes so the sauce in the pan could thicken and become gooey and sticky on the ribs.

The flavor is excellent if you like a sweet sauce (which I do sometimes).  Although the recipe is perfect as is, I have this desire to replace the honey with maple syrup next time just to see what happens.

I have made these twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I made some changes and the meat was much more tender and the flavor was much more infused in the meat. Changes: 1. Remove the thin layer of filmy tissue on the back of ribs. 2. Pat ribs dry and apply a rub. Put meat in fridge for at least 6 hours or overnight.  You can use your own rub if you have one you like, but here is a basic one. Mix together- 1tbs kosher salt, 1tbs brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp chile powder. Put one tbs of rub on each side of meat and pat in. 3. Don't cut ribs up as directed. Instead roast whole rack of ribs on 300 degrees for 3-4 hours; remember what you are trying to simmulate here is barbecue, which means low temp and slow cook. The ribs are ready when you pick them up in the middle and they droop down at the ends and the meat by the tongs just starts to develop small cracks. One last tip. As with most braised meats the ribs will be good after you take them out of the oven, but they will be even better if you cool them down over night and re-heat the next day.

These are the BEST!!i!!!  They turned out to the best ribs we have had-ever, restaurant or otherwise! We love ribs-but have never attempted them at home-this recipe inspired me to give ribs a try.   Yes the rub is more like sauce when mixed up and yes they are very watery at first when you begin to cook them but with a little patience the magic happens!!!  Here's what we did: bought the pork baby backs from Sam's (6-7 lbs)followed the sauce/rub to a tee, took membrane off bony side, cut ribs invidual portions cutting after every other rib bone, then slathered just enough sauce to completely slather each rib.  Put in deep roaster covered with foil, poked a ton of holes to vent in oven at 325.  After 45-hour, took out and turned (they were very watery) put foil half on/half on/half off and back in the oven, 2 hour did the same (still watery-but less) covered very loosely with foil, 3rd hour the sauce was coming together, getting very sticky-turned ribs, kept foil off and put back in oven.  Meanwhile, I put the rest of the sauce in pan on stove, cooked on very low and let it get very hot, bubbly and thick.  After about 15 minutes-took ribs back out of oven and used a brush to paint ribs with the awesome sauce, put back in oven at 375 for about 10 minutes.  When the came out the meat was perfet,meaty and tender, and the sauce sticky dark and sweet!  We can't wait to eat the left overs and can't stop talking about them!

I food processed the onion to a fine almost puree.

I was short on time and decided to try this since the cooking time was only an hour.  I read all the 5 star reviews and noticed that almost everyone has been using the low and slow cook method for this.  That is how I normally always do mine also.  But I figured, what the heck, lets go exactly by the recipe and see how they turn out.  After cooking an hour, I noticed the sauce was runny and wasnt sticking to the ribs.  So I uncovered and cooked another 30 min. to thicken and give the ribs a nice crust.  The ribs werent as tender as we like them.  I was afraid of this, but they was still edible.  We also didnt care for the sauce.  For us there was too much honey in it that it overpowered the rest of the ingredients.  Overall I have to give the original recipe 3 stars.  I deducted 1 for not caring for the sauce, and another 1 for the cooking method.  Like many others, if you do the low and slow method, this would definitely have been a 4 star for us.

Grated the onion in the food processor and combined with all ingredients except BBQ sauce. Was afraid I messed it up since it was thin, and was hoping it wouldn't just run off into the pan. Poured the BBQ sauce on top. Used a nonstick roasting pan which worked perfectly. Baked at 325 degrees for four hours without taking a peek, and it came out of the oven absolutely perfect. Did broil the top for a few minutes to get more of a crust but would consider that optional. Excellent sauce, sweet but not too much so, great balance of flavors.

I have never used pork back ribs and unfortunately will most likely not be using them again.  My family prefers country style ribs and I think this sauce would be perfect on them as well and I will try it.  I followed suggestions and did the low and slow method for 3.5 hrs.  on 325. For the first 2.5 hours I cooked it with everything but the barbecue sauce covered in foil.  For the remaining hour I basted it with the barbecue sauce (calls for too much in my opinion) and continued cooking.  For the final 15 minutes I removed the foil to let it get a little crispy on top.  The flavor is perfect but these type of ribs are far too fatty for me.  Also I would recommend cooking them on top of foil so when the honey/brown sugar burns it does not stick to the bottom of your pan and create a mess.

To my - and my son&#039;s - complete surprise and delight, these turned out DELICIOUS and so easy that even I could do it :-) . This will be my go-to recipe for ribs from now on.  Next time I will try the suggestion of a few other reviewers and cook low and slow.  I did finish them off under a low broil for 5 minutes each side to caramelize the top and bottom (with extra sauce that I had reserved for this purpose).  I would like to thank the author of this recipe for posting it here for others to enjoy."},{"name":"peruvian stuffed potatoes   papa rellena","steps":"preparation:', 'wash potatoes and place them in a medium size pan with salted water', 'bring to a boil', 'cook until soft', 'remove from heat', 'peel', 'force potatoes through a strainer or a potato masher', 'cool', 'add 1 egg and knead dough until smooth and soft', 'pour 2 or 3 tablespoons oil in a large size skillet', 'cook onion and garlic until golden', 'add ground beef', 'add tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes', 'add parsley , cilantro , olives , hardboiled eggs and raisins', 'season with salt , pepper and paprika', 'flour hands and take a portion of potato mixture', 'place it in the palm of your hand', 'flatten it and place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center', 'fold it and close by pressing ends', 'it must have an oval shape', 'flour croquettes and set them aside', 'repeat this process with the rest of potato', 'heat oil in a medium size pan and fry papa rellena until golden', 'papa rellena is served with white rice and onion creole sauce', '8 servings'","description":"this is a very traditional main course from peruvian cuisine and one of my favorite dishes,  i copy paste this recipe from http://www.yanuq.com/english/recipe.asp?idreceta=254","ingredients":"white potatoes', 'salt', 'pepper', 'eggs', 'oil', 'ground beef', 'onion', 'garlic clove', 'paprika', 'black olives', 'tomatoes', 'parsley', 'cilantro', 'raisins'","review":"Best recipe I have EVER used.

Mixing the listed ingredients was a breeze. The thing that took the longest was removing the membrane from the back of the ribs and then slicing them individually for the cooking process. I followed other reviews recommendations by going low and slow. I cooked them at 325&deg; for 1 hour (flipping them every 30 minutes and basting with standing juices/rub). I then lowered the temp to 300&deg; since they looked like they might still be cooking to fast for me. I let them go another hour (flipping again every 30 minutes). Because I wanted to finish these on my charcoal grill, I again turned my temp down to 200&deg; and let them continue low and slow while I got my grill ready. After cooking at 200&deg; for an hour and my grill was ready, I removed them from the oven and took them outside to finish them on the grill. I placed them on the &quot;cold side&quot; of the grill - not directly over the hot coals. I let them grill for 10-15 minutes while I basted them in the remaining rub/juices from the pan. Removed them from the grill putting them back in the pan and covered them with tin-foil for 10-15 minutes to let the meat rest.  The flavor was great, a tad sweet, so next time I might recede or eliminate the white sugar. Overall, I would and will make these again!

Within two days I have made it twice. I'm so glad to have made this easy to make, healthy and so deeeelish fish recipe. I have used catfish and tilapia and it was great. The breading is very easy to made and because only dry ingredients are used you can make in advance. I love the taste of mustard and the milk mixture gives just the right amount of mustard flavour without overpowering the other flavours. Because I like it spicy, I have added a little more of cayenne pepper and it was fantastic. Love the taste of the breading and the texture of it. In opposite to pan seared fish it remains dry and is not soaked with oil. You can use any of your favorite dips with this fish too, try you favorite salsa or dip. Or maybe try a little dijon mustard with the fish to support this flavour. The fish is easy to make and it really needs not more than 4 minutes from each side. The second time I have made this recipe I cut the fillet into smaller pieces to have more of the breading and the outcome was a fantastic finger food. I tried the leftovers cold and still was so good that I have had it with mustard and salad as a sandwich. Thank you so much Hope for this wonderful recipe.

It's a solid recipe that goes together fast using basic pantry ingredients, and dinner can be on the table in a snap."},{"name":"pesto  feta  and sun dried tomato scones","steps":"preheat oven to 400 f', 'butter or lightly spray a 9 inch cake pan', 'set aside', 'in a large bowl whisk together the flour , sugar , baking powder and salt until combined', 'cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs', 'make a well in the center of the dry ingredients , add the milk , and stir gently with a wooden spoon until mixture forms moist clumps', 'do not over mix', 'gather dough together with hands and place on a lightly floured surface', 'knead until smooth', 'roll dough with a floured rolling pin into a 16x 10 inch rectangle', 'with a knife or metal spatula evenly spread pesto over dough', 'sprinkle with feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes', 'starting at the short end , roll dough into a cylinder , brushing off any excess flour as you roll', 'with a sharp knife , cut dough in half , and then in half again', 'cut each quarter into 3 equal pieces and place in the prepared pan , cut- side up', 'brush lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan cheese', 'bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes or until lightly browned on top and toothpick inserted in center of scone comes out clean', 'cool on wire rack'","description":"a lovely scone to go with dinner.","ingredients":"all-purpose flour', 'sugar', 'baking powder', 'salt', 'butter', 'milk', 'pesto sauce', 'feta cheese', 'sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil', 'extra virgin olive oil', 'parmesan cheese'","review":"the tilapia was good but not as crispy as i would have liked. i didn't want to over cook it so i cooked it about 10 min. i will prepare again. thanks for the recipe."},{"name":"pesto  ham  prosciutto    cheese sandwich","steps":"spread one side of each slice of bread with a tbsp of pesto sauce', 'layer on the tomato ham and cheese', 'cover with the other slice of bread , cut& serve'","description":"this is a very tasty sandwich. use good quality italian bread or lovely homemade coarse textured type . i have also used french crusty rolls. increase for as many sandwiches as you want.","ingredients":"bread', 'pesto sauce', 'tomatoes', 'prosciutto', 'cheese', 'lettuce'","review":"This recipe should not have even one bad review.
