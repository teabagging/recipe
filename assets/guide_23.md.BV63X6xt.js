The brats themselves came out very tender and juicy. I had no idea that sauerkraut when cooked down over medium heat for 45 1/2 hour to 45 minutes turned brown (burnt like). It was really good! Now for the changes I made. I did not have celery seed so I used celery salt, I also used minced garlic from the jar. Because it was late when I started, I couldn't see why 3 and 4 could not be combined... and that's exactly what I did. The brats went in right after the kraut, brown sugar, celery salt, and bay leaf. All cooked together for 45 minutes, stirring and turning occassionally.  I don't know what difference it made doing the kraut and other ingredients for 1/2 hour, THEN adding the brats for 45 minutes.

Delicious, healthy and satisfying. I was able to serve at least 10  portions at a potluck...the rest was scooped up in a flash and there were no leftovers! ;)<br/><br/>I got tons of compliments. It was relatively easy to make. I would allow an hour and a half to two hours the first time I prepare this to have enough time to chop everything and simmer. It should go faster after that (once you've familiarized yourself with the recipe.) The nice thing is you can clean up most your dishes while the curry is simmering, and your kitchen will be nearly done by the time it's ready to eat.<br/><br/>Did other cooks bother with chopping your carrots ends to get a 1 cm. square shape as opposed to the normal round shape? And if so, did you include or exclude the extras?<br/><br/>My local grocery store was out of the red lentils, so I used the green lentils to match the cabbage color for continuity of presentation (even though it shouldn't matter on taste). I checked several stores and all the diced tomatoes cans come in either 14.5 oz or 28 oz. Did you buy the larger size and do the full 15 oz? (I know it was stated that the measurements are fast and loose). As suggested by other reviewers, I chopped almost four fresh roma tomatoes which yields just about 2 cups.<br/><br/>Make sure you tend to your onions in stirring because 1 tbsp broth evaporates fast in five minutes time.<br/><br/>I served this with a black & mahogony rice blend.<br/><br/>I can't wait to experiment and try this with some other veggies like zucchini (although it's perfect just the way it is). I will definitely be making this again (I'm sure by request.)"},{"name":"foil baked asparagus","steps":"preheat oven to 180 c', 'prepare asparagus by snapping the lower woody part of the stem off , and peel the lower section if they\\\\'re a bit old or thick', 'tear off a large enough piece of aluminium foil to wrap around the bunch of asparagus securely , and place asparagus in foil', 'dot with butter and sprinkle lightly with salt', 'wrap securely , and then wrap an extra strip of foil around the', 'bake in oven for 25-35 mins , depending on the thickness and age of the asparagus', try to wait until you're ready to serve before you unwrap them , or better still , serve them still wrapped in the foil]","description":"a very simple method of cooking asparagus, where they are wrapped in foil and baked, with nothing but a little butter and salt. so easy and yet so delicious!! my 2 1/2 year old daughter liked it too!\\ni've only tried this once and i followed the recipe exactly as set out, but i'd like to try it again, perhaps putting a few sprigs of herbs in with it. you could also try herb butter instead of ordinary butter. you can omit the salt if you like.\\nif you are making larger quantities you might need to make more than one parcel. you could even wrap each portion separately and serve them in the foil wrappers - i ate mine straight out of the foil, and i think it made them even nicer as they're still steaming hot and in their cooking juices, and you can keep all that flavour and aroma trapped in the parcel until you're ready to eat it! would make a really good starter served like this. although i suppose it depends what kind of guests you've got - if they're used to silver platters they might not be so impressed with silver foil!! but i would be! :)","ingredients":"asparagus', 'butter', 'salt'","review":"This had really great flavor, and it was very filling. I also got to use up a bunch of veggies in it. I gave it 4 stars because the lentils (I used green split ones) did NOT soften a whole lot in 30 minutes. In fact, I cooked it for about an hour, and they were still just sorta softer. I covered the pot the last 15 minutes or so, so it wouldn't lose all the moisture (I guess you could add more both if you needed to, but I didn't). We ended up just eating the lentils more firm (more soft is how we like them), because it was getting kind of late. It turned out the lentil texture was almost welcome, because with the extended cooking time, all the other veggies were much softer. <br/>I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the cilantro, and I added 1 tsp garam masala. I served it over white rice, and we had flatbread with it. We (my husband and I) didn't feel that it needed any extra salt or pepper, but he did say it was REALLY good with Sriracha sauce on it. I didn't put anything on mine. I'd make this again. I might soak the lentils for a bit next time, though.

We easily peeled the tester egg after refrigeration, and I was particularly impressed with the lightness of the egg white.  It's not as rubbery as the boiling technique and the yolks were nicely centered.  Next time I'll reduce the timing a little bit, to avoid overcooking.  Although it wasn't as bad as when they're boiled, I still found the outer rim of the yolk slightly grayed.

This was absolutely delicious and earned 5 stars each from two picky 5 year old girls!  I loved how quick and easy this was.  I have never seen Chinese broccoli, but will be asking my local grocery manager about it next time I see him, cause I'd really like to try it.  But even with western broccoli this was a hit.  The way I extracted the ginger juice is by thawing two 1-inch pieces of ginger root (with the peel on) until they were feeling mushy.  Then I just rolled, pinched and squeezed them while the juice drained into a measuring spoon.  Each 1-inch piece provides about a 1/2 teaspoon.  In this recipe, I then just diced up the squeezed root pieces for the stir fry.  The ginger flavor was definitely not over-powering.  It was a really nice compliment to the fresh broccoli flavor.  I could have cooked my broccoli a little longer, as they were pretty al dente, but I like some crunch in my veggies and no one else minded either.  Ev, thanks for sharing another fantastic recipe.

Anyway, this one was very similar in flavor, but overall, it was even better. Following Kittencal's general recommendation, here's what I added to the burger when I mixed it before making up my patties: 1/2 a medium onion (diced), one 2 oz. packet of onion soup mix, 1/4 tsp. garlic salt, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 cup seasoned Italian bread crumbs, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. black pepper, 1/4 c. whole milk, and 1 egg -- it was just very slightly on the salty side so next time, I'll omit the teaspoon of salt. Also, I finished the dish in the oven, 375 degrees F. (covered) for 90 minutes and it came out perfect! All the remaining ingredients were right on the money as listed. Also, the home made french fries could not possibly be a better complement to this dish -- skip the mashed potato thing and go with the fries on this one, folks  (I left the peelings on too).
