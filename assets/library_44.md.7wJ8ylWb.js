I rolled it a little large and got more than 12 rolls, but the frosting amount was just perfect. I think next time I would increase the amount of sugar in the dough, and use cinnamon sugar with extra cinnamon, maybe even adding cinnamon extract to the frosting.

I almost went for a white wine vinegar substitution, but decided against it, and was pleasantly surpirsed - the apple flavor was not overwhelming with both a sour and sweet taste - Just right. One thing for you measurement junkies out there - the proportions here seemed WAY OFF to me for a prodigious amount of salad. I used about 1/2 of a medium head of red-leaf lettuce - way more then 1 1/2 cups - just to make sure I had enough for two for two nights, and an equivalent amount of spinach. Everything seemed to remain just about right, save for the onions. I would also add more apples, maybe two cups instead of 1. Also, I couldn't find bleu cheese, so used feta, and was glad for it - the briny feta taste was EXCELLENT with the sweet/sour apple flavors. I would suggest using feta packed in brine, if possible. Adding nuts instead of the bacon seems like a good plan to keep the flavors light, but I used neither.

The bread has a fluffy texture and the coarse chopped walnuts and the diced zucchini add additional different textures.

Sorry!\\n\\nThat said, I made this recipe having never even tasted Pecan Pie.  I served it at a big Thanksgiving meal without disclosing that it was vegan, or that I had made it, and watched the reactions.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the pie, and I did, too.  \\n\\nI definitely think it can be improved, though.  It has a very light taste, while I think Pecan Pie should be rather rich.  In the future, I think I will use more margarine (Earth Balance Buttery Sticks are great), more brown sugar, and some Xantham Gum or Agar Agar to alter the filling texture a bit.  It looked more like a caramel than anything.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a recipe worth trying and improving upon."},{"name":"sandra s hot dip","steps":"place all ingredients in microwave safe bowl and microwave until bubbly , about 4- 6 minutes', 'serve with taco chips like frittos', 'this recipe may be made ahead of time and reheated as needed'","description":"this is a great cheesy dip that you can serve at parties and such. it's easy to make since you melt it all in the microwave. i could eat this stuff all night. i got the recipe from my aunt who got it from her sister-in-law sandra. so that is why it is called sandra's hot dip.","ingredients":"cream cheese', 'hormel chili', 'scallion', 'monterey jack pepper cheese'","review":"I made this for Thanksgiving and was not impressed.
