I do prefer more of a &#039;New York&#039; style,more dry than moist like this. To be fair, I live just blocks from the Pacific Ocean and that seems to add moisture to everything I bake.

I ended up finally turning the oven off and leaving the door open with the cake inside for another hour.  I then left it in the pan overnight and removed the sides the following morning.  I put cherry pie filling around the edges and then in the very center to hide all the flaws.

A better alternative for those with diabetes, or other issues in which regular granulated sugars (white and brown) are not an option, coconut nectar is a great option.  It has a low glycemic index and does not taste of coconut; it has a brown sugar flavor.  It has been a life saver for my diabetic elderly mother (for whom I prepare meals).

The salad provides necessary respite from the intense flavor, although baked potato wedges are an option.  Two of these might be 1 serving for a lumberjack, but one would be enough for most people.  I had never boiled eggs this way before.  One egg peeled itself during the last 2 minutes of boiling, and the shells practically fell off the rest during the draining and cooling. However, the yolks did appear to be centered once we cut into the final product. The bacon made it easier to remove the eggs from the muffin tin.  Next time, I would put some raw diced potato at the bottom of each tin to raise the Scotch egg from the tin bottom and soak up the grease, so the bottom could brown as well. (Scrape off the potato before serving.)  (Note: 220 C is 425 F.) I would serve these for lunch or supper, or take on a picnic. All in all, this recipe reminds me that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, and these Scotch eggs could lead to a proposal.

It tasted like it was some expensive dish in a restaurant!  I was skeptical about adding the soy sauce, but it works. I added the tequila, but really didn't notice it much when I tasted the dish. I halved the recipe for my family and found that there wasn't enough sauce, so I ended up doubling the sauce.  So I would say to others to use either half the pasta (I used dry) for the recipe or double the sauce for a whole pound.  I also added some fresh cilantro on top when I served it.  I wasn't sure my 11 yo daughter would like this but she had seconds!  I'll have to hide the parmesan from my dh when he gets home as this is not really a parmesan-type dish.  I saw this recipe on another website that this is a dish at California Pizza Kitchen restaurants. I may have to order it next time I eat there to see the comparison!

I just made this tonight with a recipe nearly identical to this one, but not found on this site.  If you don't have a few hours to devote to this dish from beginning to end, I would recommend doing all the prep work ahead and/or making the cream sauce ahead.  Please note, the most important part of this recipe is the cream sauce and it is very important to get it to a paste like consistency.  This may take 10-15 minutes once the stock, etc. is added.  In the similar recipe I used, the cream is added to the cilantro garlic paste and reduced down my a half cup.  I also used a total of 5-6 tbls (3 small limes) of fresh lime in both the sauce and the chicken.   You may skin the jalepenos (by blistering 4 mins and removing skin with paper towel) before you mince them to make a smoother sauce. Don't skimp on ingredients if you want the CPK experience.  Also if you are worried about calories or fat, this recipe is not for YOU. The time to prepare this to completion was 2.25 hours of which most is prep work.  I could not tell the difference between my version and CPK and this is one of my most favorite pasta dishes on earth."},{"name":"hickory glazed salmon","steps":"saut shallots in vegetable oil until medium brown', 'add apple juice concentrate , balsamic vinegar , liquid smoke , and onion powder', 'stir to combine ingredients', 'simmer 7 minutes', 'combine water and cornstarch , mix well and whisk into simmering liquid', 'simmer 5 more minutes , stirring occasionally', 'place in appropriate container and allow to cool', 'preheat oven to 450 degrees', 'oil bottom of roasting pan', 'place salmon fillets on pan', 'liberally brush each piece of salmon with the hickory glaze', 'roast salmon for 15 to 20 minutes , depending upon thickness'","description":"this is a red lobster copycat recipe.","ingredients":"salmon fillets', 'shallot', 'vegetable oil', 'apple juice concentrate', 'balsamic vinegar', 'liquid smoke flavoring', 'onion powder', 'cornstarch', 'water'","review":"Delicious!

Also - important!!! I used 1/2 and 1/2 and it worked just as well as the heavy cream.  Save yourself a few calories and use 1/2 and 1/2 with no loss of flavor!  Prior review: This was JUST like CPK... couple of tips... cut and chop and prepare all ingredients first...  Then start to cook.  I reduced the jalapeno (lots of jalapeno - but no membrane / no seeds), stock, cilantro mixture on low simmer for a long time -- as our dinner was delayed.  I suspect on a somewhat aggressive boil you could do this in 20 - 30 min... I think I simmered for about an hour... I got this down till all the stock / tequila was basically evaporated and only vegetables and the butter remained.  I did 2X the ingredients to 24oz of dry macaroni.   I was concerned that the veg / cream mixture was not going to thicken - but once I added the al dente macaroni and all was in a single (large) pan - the cream was soaked up by the pasta and it was just a smidge too dry.  (for my taste).  Given a double recipe - it was 8 Large servings (3 oz pasta ea).  Some guests took take-home containers...  All diners agreed I could have had more peppers and onions.  So...next time - I&#039;d probably do 1.5 sauce and 2X vegetables for 1X pasta - when I make this again.  Because this rocked it out.  SO GOOD.  Hubby used to order this at CPK - and asked if it was too much work to cook just for him.  LOL.  Will be making again... and I suspect I&#039;ll be trying it with 1/2 and 1/2 to see about bringing this down a bit in calories."},{"name":"hickory smoke salt","steps":"mix salt and liquid smoke together in a small bowl', 'add more salt or liquid smoke to make a mixture resembling very moist brown sugar', 'spread salt out on a cookie sheet', 'allow to dry at room temperature or dry in your oven on the lowest temperature', 'stir and rub salt between your fingers periodically', 'room temp salt is ready the next day , oven dried should be ready in a couple of hours', 'store in a jar with a tight lid'","description":"after running to three grocery stores looking for hickory smoke salt and unable to find it, i decided to try and make my own. it worked out great!  considering the price of smoke salt, i'll never buy it again!","ingredients":"sea salt', 'liquid smoke'","review":"Wow!

Please learn it! It's NOT an authentic hungarian goulash, NOT even a hungarian goulash, because our goulash is a SOUP!!!! And basic is a stew, but not like this! Ketchup, brown sugar, bay leaves?!?! Oh, gosh. I don't know who is the mother of this recipe, but please, don't call it goulash!!!! <br/>I'm Hungarian, I think I know it.... <br/>Here is the recipe:<br/>this is indeed a thick liquid soup ? the preparation starts exactly the same way as of a stew but then more water is added, plus vegetables (a few carrots, parnsnips and a lot of cubed potatoes). In terms of spices, it contains caraway seeds. So, it has really a soup consistancy. This one is made of beef only.<br/>There a two SECRETS of a good goulash: the ingredients you add to it and the ones you don?t. In my opinion the secret ingredient of a perfect Hungarian stew (besides a good quality Hungarian paprika of course) is onion. A lot. More. A lot more!! For 1 kg meat (two pounds) I would use about 3-4 big onions. That seem to be a lot but this will create your thick sauce. As you?re simmering the stew on very low heat for about 1,5 hours, the onions melt into a sweet, spicy sauce, so you won?t have any pieces of it at the end.<br/>What you NEVER ever would add to a p?rk?lt are any of the following ones: flour, butter, canned tomatoes (all three I see in many ?authentic? recipes)."},{"name":"holiday chex mix","steps":"mix cereal , almonds , pretzels , and coconut in a large bowl', 'meanwhile , in a medium saucepan combine butter , sugar , and karo', 'over medium heat melt the butter and blend ingredients together', 'stir while heating , and once it comes to a boil , cook for 2 minutes', 'set a timer because if it cooks too long it will be too hard', if it doesn't cook long enough it will be too soft, 'once it has cooked at a full boil for 2 minutes take the mixture off the heat', 'sprinkle in the topped candy canes', 'as you sprinkle in the candy cane , whisk to prevent large lumps', 'pour over the top of the cereal mixture in bowl and stir until all cereal is well coated', 'then pour onto a greased cookie sheet and top with sprinkles if you want', 'let cool , store in a zip lock bag and enjoy !'","description":"this recipe is a keeper!  it's a great way to use up cereal you may have purchased on sale, and it's such a delicious snack you'll have a hard time stopping.  use any cereal you like (chex, cinnamon toast crunch, life, or whatever you have on hand).  i tried this with cheerios, captain crunch, cocoa puffs, raisin bran, and whatever else i could find.  my only thought for next time is why not add some miniature marshmallows to the mix?  recipe courtesy of a thrifty mom.  serving size is estimated.  thank you!","ingredients":"cereal', 'coconut', 'almonds', 'pretzels', 'sugar', 'light karo syrup', 'butter', 'candy cane'","review":"Having lived in Hungary, I know that &quot;goulash&quot; (gulyas) is actually a soup, and not a meat-and-noodle dish, but despite the misnaming of the dish, this beef concoction can actually be a tasty dinner.\\n\\nI followed the directions, only substituting hot Hungarian paprika for the bland, tasteless red powder that adorns many supermarket shelves, and that made all the difference!

Loved the onions and garlic, and the green pepper was good too.  I put this in a large metal roasting pan, was careful to cut the potatoes in quarters, preheated the oven well, and kept it in for the full 30 minutes (mixing once) but my potatoes were slightly underdone.  I don't think my oven is malfunctioning, anyway.  Next time I will cook for an extra ten minutes.  Thanks for this recipe Paula.
