This typical Dutch dish originates from the days of the Spanish occupation. The people of Leiden (Holland) were nearly starving to death during the Spanish occupation of their city when William of Orange decided to have the city flooded. His fleet sailed in and arrived just in time to bring food to the starving people of Leiden. A story goes that a boy was sent out to scout the Spanish positions. Finding them abandoned, he returned to the city with a kettle full of food he had found (Hutspot, a dish featuring mashed potatoes, carrots and onions) The citizens, being extremely hungry after months of siege, feasted upon this contraband of war. This dish is still eaten on the 3rd of October, when the city of Leiden celebrates it's liberation from the Spanish aggressor in 1574. This is a pretty basic and simple recipe - I generally use 4 large potatoes, 6 carrots (peeled & sliced into 1 inch pieces), 2 onions and 250 grams of cubed bacon. I boil 1 & 1/2 of the sliced onions with the potatoes and the carrots I boil separately. I saut 1/2 of one sliced onion with the cubed bacon. When it is time to mash - I mash only enough for everything to mix in well together - but for some of the carrots to still be in chunks. I then mix in the cubed bacon & onion mixture, along with a bit of milk, butter and salt and pepper to taste. This amount is more then enough for 4 people and is great served along traditional Dutch rookworst."},{"name":"chewy  fudgy triple chocolate brownies","steps":"adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350f spray 8-inch square baking pan with nonstick vegetable cooking spray', 'fold two 12-inch pieces of foil lengthwise so that they measure 7 inches wide', 'fit one sheet in bottom of greased pan , pushing it into corners and up sides of pan', 'overhang will help in removal of baked brownies', 'following illustration 1 below , fit second sheet in pan in same manner , perpendicular to first sheet', 'spray foil with nonstick cooking spray', 'in medium heatproof bowl set over a pan of almost-simmering water , melt chocolates and butter , stirring occasionally until mixture is smooth', 'whisk in cocoa until smooth', 'set aside to cool slightly', 'whisk together eggs , sugar , vanilla , and salt in medium bowl until combined , about 15 seconds', 'whisk warm chocolate mixture into egg mixture', 'then stir in flour with wooden spoon until just combined', 'pour mixture into prepared pan , spread into corners , and level surface with rubber spatula', 'bake until slightly puffed and toothpick inserted in center comes out with a small amount of sticky crumbs clinging to it , 35 to 40 minutes', 'cool on wire rack to room temperature , about 2 hours , then remove brownies from pan using foil handles', 'cut into 1-inch squares and serve'","description":"from cook's illustrated published may 2000.  this recipe makes a heck of a good brownie!  these are very rich and decadent, it is best to cut them in small, 1 inch squares.","ingredients":"semisweet chocolate', 'unsweetened chocolate', 'unsalted butter', 'cocoa powder', 'eggs', 'granulated sugar', 'vanilla extract', 'table salt', 'unbleached all-purpose flour'","review":"I have this very same recipe in an old cookbook from the 1940's.

brother. i haven't tried it yet, but he absolutely raved about it. preparation time does not include brining time.\\n\\nauthor's notes: leave it to alice waters and her crew at chez panisse to come up with a recipe that's so simple and so brilliant it brings out the best in chicken, pork, or turkey. they've created a brine with sugar, salt, and just a few seasonings that infuse loads of flavor into the meats. to test how well the brine worked, i cooked two chickens side by side. one had been soaked in the brine for 24 hours, the other was simply roasted. both cavities were filled with italian parsley, preserved lemons, and onions, and cooked in a 400-degree oven. the difference was remarkable. while the regular roasted chicken had a deeper, richer skin color, the brined chicken was plump and juicy, albeit a little anemic in color. but the flavor was amazing and it was the moistest chicken i can ever remember eating. the next day i warmed the leftovers and the regular chicken was even drier and had that typical day-old taste, but the brined chicken still tasted moist and fresh. to achieve the browned skin you'll have to leave the chicken in the oven a little longer, but the meat will still be moist. we also tried a pork roast, brined for three days, and it came out fabulous, too. the leftovers were particularly good for sandwiches the next day. the recipe makes enough brine for a large turkey. if brining only one chicken or a pork roast, cut the recipe in half.\\n\\n\\nsource: the secrets of success cookbook by michael bauer","ingredients":"cold water', 'kosher salt',

I would also use a very thin amount of cookie for the base, and undercook them (the cookie base), as they continue cooking and easily become too brown.  It also would recommend filling them to the tops as the recipe suggests- they do rise, then fall.

ferdinand, crown prince of austria; william henry jackson; charles dickens jr.; p.t. barnum; thomas edison; clark gable; f.w. woolworth; and j. paul getty.\\n\\neach morning, guests were given programs detailing the evening's entertainment. they enjoyed a formal dinner, then delighted in a concert on the hotel grounds. afterward, they were encouraged to walk across the street to soda springs for a glass of fresh springwater before retiring. the cliff house even had underground tunnels leading from the hotel to the spa.\\n\\nin later years, a bathhouse was built at the spa, and bellboys from the hotel would cross to the spring to fill bottles and glasses with sparkling water for the guests. the cliff house at pikes peak soon became the most popular hotel and spa in the colorado springs region, drawing people from all walks of life and from around the world.\\n\\nfor all its successes, the cliff house also endured some hard times. in 1921, a flash flood roared down williams canyon and washed through the hotel's grill room, a small sandwich and soda shop in the rear of the east wing, buckling the floor all the way to the ceiling.\\n\\ncalifornia real estate developer james s. morley bought the cliff house in 1981, converting the historic building into a 42-unit apartment building. but in its second disaster of the century, the building caught fire in march 1982. the fourth-floor roof sustained so much damage it had to be replaced, and the interior was stripped of all plumbing, plaster and floor coverings. the water damage was so extensive that the entire building was threatened. immediate action was taken to preserve what remained. due to the local economy, the building stood vacant for 16 years.\\n\\nsince the cliff house had been placed on the national register of historic places, the fire also raised concerns among citizens groups and government agencies that supported its renovation.\\n\\nin 1997, morley committed to the restoration, vowing to return the hotel to its original distinction, preserving the rocky mountain victorian architecture of the 1800s, but incorporating 21st century state-of-the-art technology and amenities. after $9 million worth of refurbishing and loving care, this vision has been realized.","ingredients":"bread', 'unsalted butter', 'eggs', 'frangelico', 'vanilla extract', 'sugar', 'salt', 'heavy cream', 'cinnamon', 'nutmeg', 'chicken breasts', 'salt and pepper', 'olive oil', 'grand marnier', 'sherry wine vinegar', 'oranges, juice of', 'oranges', 'fresh spinach'","review":"I made these great shells.

I did substitute butter for the margarine. It is true that the loaf itself isn't very sweet, but I LIKE that about it; it is a tea loaf, not a dessert cake.  The lemon glaze is perfect--a little sweetness that keeps the loaf moist.  (I do recommend using a skewer rather than a toothpick for the holes, to get the glaze in deeper.) Pour the glaze quite slowly and carefully so it seeps into the holes rather than pouring off the sides (as it really wants to do :-) ).\\nFinally, I did follow the directions precisely in terms of time and temperature, but clearly the center wasn't totally done because as it was cooling a deep wide crack appeared in the center.

I love the blend of cream cheese, cottage cheese and sour cream!  I have to admit, I made a lot of adjustments to match my supplies:  I used whole wheat rotini pasta because the bag of egg noodles I was sure was in the cupboard was not there!  I started off with ground round that I had previously browned with onion and frozen, so I thawed in the microwave and added the italian seasoning.  We always use reduced fat cream cheese and cottage cheese, and fat free sour cream, so that's what I used.  I left out the butter.   I baked covered for the first 2/3 of the baking time.  Lastly, I had some lovely fresh mushrooms from farmer's market a couple of days ago that we're just not using up fast enough on our salads, so I sliced those and threw them on top the last 15 minutes of the baking time.

I doubled the recipe, and for the onion, I used 3/4 cup of diced red onion, I also added 2 large cloves of garlic, (minced)\\nbut only had 13.5 ounces of the fresh broccoli, so I added 1 cup of chopped frozen broccoli. I also added 1 cup of (chopped) matchstix carrots, as well as, 1 cup of shredded carrots. I didn't have 16 ounces of shredded sharp cheddar to add to the soup, (just 12 ounces of cheese) and I thought that was all the soup needed, so if I ever decide to make a single batch of this soup, I will only add 6 ounces, not 8 ounces. One other thing I wanted to mention...when it came to adding the half-and-half, I just added 2 cups, plus 2 cups of 2% milk.  Also, I added 2-(14.5 oz) cans of the broth, as well as 2/3 cup of water, and a heaping teaspoonful of chicken granules. I skipped adding salt to the soup in the stockpot, but did add quite a bit of black pepper. I prefered adding the salt to the individual bowls of soup, rather than to the pot. I also skipped adding the nutmeg to the pot of soup, but I did add some to my bowl of soup, but since I didn't think it added much flavor to the soup, I say omit this spice all together. I did top our bowls of soup with Cheddar & Garlic flavored croutons, and I thought they tasted great in the soup. In all this was a great tasting soup, one which I look forward to making again.

I use sharp cheddar (usually just the Albertson's store brand, nothing special) and it has a wonderful cheese flavor.  To those that say it is flavorless - did you add salt? I don't measure how much I use, just add a bit at a time until it tastes right, but it's at least 1-2 teaspoons (in a double batch).  I also add a bit of black or mixed pepper.  I like it better without the nutmeg, so have stopped using it, and didn't have any carrots the first time I made it and have just never added since.  I had this soup at Panera a couple weeks ago, and thought taste and texture were very similar.  I didn't taste nutmeg in their's, either.  I did have the cheese curdle once.

I did add some garlic to the onions, and sauteed the carrots (which I grated) with the onions and garlic.  Just a note about curdling....the lower the fat content in the milk product (half & half, milk, cream, etc) you use, the higher your risk of curdling.  The higher fat content protects it from curdling as easily.  That being said, you can still use low or no-fat products, but you have to take great care not to let them boil.

I made it primarily because it's cold outside and my husband enjoys broccoli cheese soup.  I read many other reviews and in my opinion, much of the success of this recipe came down to the cheese . . . seriously, use good cheese. Someone wrote using Cabot cheese, I never heard of it.  However, as I sauntered the aisles of my grocery store I saw Cabot cheese and bought it.  It melted nicely and gave the soup a creamy cheesey bite aka sharp flavor.  Overall, my soup did have a wonderful consistency -- not too thin, nor thick.    I ended up using a lb of broccoli which was the way it came packaged at my store.  I will say, make sure you julienne your carrots to cook evenly with the other veggies; i.e., the broccoli.  My carrots had just a little too much crunch left to them, probably could have been cut thinner/smaller or cooked a tad longer.  I also sifted about 3/4 of the end product veggies from the soup and put them into the blender with about 1/2 cup of the broth to help the blending along.    I then put it all back into the soup -- I think this was a plus, some veggie pieces yet enough smoothness so  that it wasn't like baby food.  Spoiler alert:  When it was all finished, just for fun in my bowl, I did toss in a small pinch of the commercial brand monterrey colby/jack mix and think it sort added something.    Husband really enjoyed this soup.    I would definitely make this again."},{"name":"chicken and penne casserole","steps":"set oven to 375 degrees f', 'butter a 13 x 9-inch baking dish', 'heat oil in a skillet', 'season the chicken with salt and pepper , then brown on both sides about 5 minutes per side', 'transfer to a plate', 'add in onion , garlic , oregano , basil and crushed red pepper flakes', 'saute about 5 minutes', 'add in the crushed tomatoes , stewed tomatoes with juice , wine , sugar and bay leaf', 'cook for about 35-40 minutes , season with salt and pepper', 'line the bottom of the dish with cooked penne pasta , sprinkle the top with about 1 / 3 cup grated parmesan cheese', 'arrange the browned chicken pieces on top of the cooked pasta', 'remove bay leaf and spoon the sauce over the chicken covering chicken and pasta completely', 'mix the mozzarella cheese with 1 / 3 cup parmesan cheese , then sprinkle over the top of the sauce', 'bake for about 20 minutes , or until the chicken is cooked and the sauce is bubbly', 'delicious'","description":"i have made this recipe using bone-on chicken pieces also, although you might have to adjust the cooking time slightly. i double the crushed tomatoes to two cans when i make this, but that is optional, my family loves this casserole!","ingredients":"olive oil', 'boneless chicken breasts', 'salt and pepper', 'onion', 'garlic cloves', 'dried oregano', 'dried basil', 'dried red pepper flakes', 'crushed tomatoes', 'stewed tomatoes', 'sugar', 'dry white wine', 'bay leaf', 'dry penne pasta', 'mozzarella cheese', 'parmesan cheese'","review":"Doubled the recipe and it was wonderful with bread bowls, but go light on the nutmeg and I might use light 1/2 and 1/2 next time."},{"name":"chicken and penne parmesan","steps":"in 5 quart saucepan over medium heat , melt butter', 'add chicken', 'cook until no longer pink', 'add broth', 'heat to boiling', 'add uncooked pasta and pepper , stirring to coat pasta with liquid', 'heat to boiling', 'reduce heat', 'cover', 'simmer 7 minutes , stirring every 2 minutes', 'add asparagus , continue to cook another 7 minutes or until pasta is tender and most liquid is absorbed', 'meanwhile , in medium bowl , stir together soup , milk and 1 / 2 cup parmesan cheese until smooth', 'stir into chicken mixture', 'heat until mixture just comes to a boil', 'sprinkle with remaining cheese'","description":"can also use broccoli in place of asparagus for those that don't like it. my 3 year old grandson gobbles this up. i had tried something similar in a restaurant that was to die for, so found something similar and changed it to my tastes.","ingredients":"butter', 'boneless chicken breasts', 'chicken broth', 'penne rigate', 'fresh asparagus', 'ground black pepper', 'cream of chicken soup', 'milk', 'parmesan cheese'","review":"This is my favorite soup at Panera.

The first time I made the soup it was so creamy and delicious, I raved about it and my boyfriend begged me to make it again a week later so I did but this time the creaminess was this weird texture and I thought I had everything in the pot so I though maybe the cheese was no good or something since it had completely separated from the soup base. I gave it another try last week and the same thing, the cheese separated from the soup base. Came back to this recipe sine it worked so well the first time and realized I forgot the flour. Please learn from my repeated mistake and don't forget the flour.

This is still a very good and hearty soup, just not what I expected."},{"name":"chicken and shrimp arreganate","steps":"cook rotelli pasta according to box directions', 'slice chicken in thin chunks', 'combine flour , salt , pepper and paprika on a plate', 'dredge chicken in flour mixture', 'in a large frying pan , heat oil and brown chicken , 2 minutes each side', 'set chicken aside on a platter', 'into the same frying pan that you cooked the chicken , sautee onion and garlic until onion is transluscent , about 4 minutes', 'add tomatoes and basil', 'cook another minute', 'add chicken broth , wine and cream', 'simmer for 5 minutes', 'add the parmesan', 'season with salt and pepper to taste', 'add raw shrimp and continue to simmer 2 minutes', 'add chicken and mix well', 'sprinkle the mozarellla on top', 'cover and simmer for 5 minutes until cheese is melted', 'serve over the cooked rotelli pasta'","description":"chicken breast and shrimp in a fresh tomato creamy white wine sauce with melted mozzarella served on corkscrew pasta.  romeo's pizza in plainsboro, nj has been serving this dish for at least 20 years.  i used to order it for lunch when i worked nearby. now that i'm thousands of miles away, i decided to try to recreate it.  it's pretty close to the original.","ingredients":"rotelle pasta', 'chicken breast', 'raw shrimp', 'flour', 'salt', 'pepper', 'paprika', 'olive oil', 'onion', 'garlic cloves', 'tomatoes', 'fresh basil', 'chicken broth', 'white wine', 'heavy cream', 'parmesan cheese', 'mozzarella cheese'","review":"Yes, I have to admit, I am reviewing this recipe and made changes. But hey, it&#039;s 5 stars! I&#039;ve made Cauliflower Cheese soup for years, a thousand different ways, and experience has taught me things I can&#039;t unlearn at my age. First, I cooked the onion in a little over a 1/4 cup of butter and then just added the flour to it to cook and proceeded from there,  which is what I&#039;ve always done for other cheese sauces and soups. Secondly, it helps very much to stir pretty much the whole 20 minutes with a wooden spoon after the half and half and stock are added, as is customary with any white sauce-based soup. But always open to new ideas, I loved adding the broccoli after that and just cooking it in the sauce. (So much easier than my tried-and-true but extra-dirty-dishes method of cooking the veggies separately! Thank you!) The last change I made was that I added some shredded Monterey Jack cheese too, as I think the Panera soup is a bit smoother and creamier than a standard cheddar cheese soup and for me this made it much the same. But the gist of it is, I loved it and my daughter and I thank you!!!!"},{"name":"chicken and shrimp carbonara","steps":"preheat oven to 350 degrees', 'lightly flour chicken cubes and shrimp', 'put 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet , then heat over medium heat', 'add chicken and shrimp', 'cook 4 to 5 minutes or until no pink remains in the chicken', 'transfer to a platter and keep warm', 'heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat in the same skillet', 'add bacon or pancetta and onion', 'cook about 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly browned', 'add chicken , shrimp , salt and white pepper', 'cook 2 minutes over medium heat', 'add white wine', 'cook approximately 2 minutes or until wine has reduced by one-half', 'in a large bowl , beat eggs , cream , and italian parsley together until well blended', 'add parmesan cheese', 'stir until combined', 'pour chicken and shrimp mixture into the egg mixture', 'stir well', 'pour into a casserole shaped pyrex baking dish', 'bake in a 350-degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes , or until it begins to golden around the edges and the top', 'lightly dust top with a little bit of cracked black pepper and parmesan cheese'","description":"i love finding and trying new recipes on recipezaar.  unfortunately, some of the old family favorites tend to get temporarily forgotten and misplaced - like this one!  this is from chef joe caruso of caruso's italian ristorante (with a few slight modifications).","ingredients":"boneless skinless chicken breasts', 'shrimp', 'cooking oil', 'flour', 'bacon', 'onion', 'salt', 'white pepper', 'white wine', 'eggs', 'heavy cream', 'fresh italian parsley', 'parmesan cheese'","review":"Absolutely a fabulous recipe!!!
