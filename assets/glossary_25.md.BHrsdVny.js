The kids love bananas, so I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  The cake itself came out tender and moist.  The only problem I had was with the topping.  I looked up demerara sugar on Google, which said it is turbinado sugar.  I bought some, but it took a really long time to melt, and when it did, the topping became really brittle -- almost like toffee.  I remade the topping using regular brown sugar and it came out great, so I'm not sure what demerara sugar really should be.  Also, there was no cinnamon listed in the recipe ingredients, so when it called for adding the cinnamon I used 1/2 tsp.

(Don't ask why a person who has a farm doesn't have tomatoes as this is a question I often ask myself?) I didn't have the pudding either, but I did add the optional potato on as suggested. The mushrooms were succulent, and oh so tasty. I fried a piece of whole wheat toast, and added fresh raspberry jam. The rest went together quickly and had quite a punch for the amazing little amount of time this took to put together. The only addition was putting the potatoes in come cold water for 1/2 hour along with some thinly sliced onions. Drained them, making sure the water was removed...and doing a wonderful potato fry following your suggestions. Will at least make this once a month for Dennis and family.

I added the whole 9 ounces of chocolate to the cake mix with the result that my batter was extremely thick and very sticky and it was impossible to fold in the whisked egg whites. After having tried to fold in two thirds of the egg whites without success, I put it into the mixer. That way the batter was finally of a consistency to fold in the remaining egg white. However, it also meant that the batter was less airy because I disturbed all the air of a good part of the egg whites by using the electric mixer. My final cake (which I still glazed as I always keep a good stock of chocolate) turned out quite good. I cut the cake in very small pieces and served those with espresso. It's astonishing how much flavour the skin of a single orange can add. The combo of orange and cinnamon reminded BF and me of Christmas and I would have appreciated my cake even more in the winter. I think Kate's recipe would be in particular nice served with coffee after a dinner party around Christmas.

I will add that I am not very experienced in baking cakes or pies, so any problem I have with this cake is more than likely due to a technician error, and not the fault of the recipe.  I would have liked a slightly sweeter version of this, especially for a chocolate cake.

I have most of the pie left over.  I just cut a slice of it and cut it into pieces and mix it up and its good, so I think perhaps coating the berries in egg white or something before mixing with the sugar might make for a better blend of ingredients.

He brought over two giant (2 lb) SMOKED turkey legs and he and DH proceeded to follow the identical recipe except that they used diet 7-Up.  Because of the size of the legs, it took about 45 minutes of boiling to get these large legs to 165 degrees F.  Then they put them directly on the grill (without the onions) and brushed them with the honey and steak seasoning.  The results were outstanding!  Two 2 lb legs were more than the four adults could eat at one meal.  The combination of the sweet and the heat was fantastic.  I removed the onions from the broth and served them as well.  They were so sweet and delectible they seemed to melt in your mouth.  Once cooled, I'm going to freeze this broth - it's way too good to throw away!
