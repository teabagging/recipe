What I like about it so much that it has a Wonderful taste and seems to make the meat really tender and keeps it juicy.  This recipe actually reminds me of an Emeril Live show in the fact that this recipe tastes kicked up a notch that its so good.\\nTo start with I made it just as the recipe said and it was really good, definitely a 5 star recipe in quality, maybe just a bit saltier than we like, and just slightly more sweeter than wed ideally like, just our personal preference. I really  love it that it seems to bring out the best of the flavor of whatever meat you use it on.  What Ive found through trial and error has worked best for us is to use1/3 cup less sugar (1-2/3 cups sugar), and half the salt (1/4 cup).  For those who like more salt (like my husband, I dont) you can always add more salt later.  \\nMy very favorite thing to use it on is the frozen 4 lb. re-sealable bags of frozen chicken wings.  I take the chicken wings out of the freezer, put them on the auto defrost cycle on the microwave just long enough to get them partially thawed, which makes them wet enough for the dry rub to cling to the chicken.  Then I put the dry rub (not the whole recipe, probably about ? to 3/4 of it) in the bag with the chicken, seal it, and shake it to coat all the wings. Then I let the wings marinate in the dry rub overnight.  The wings are partially thawed so it looks like theres about a whole bottle of barbecue sauce on the wings, which the liquid helps it marinate.  Then the leftover dry rub I like to sprinkle on the chicken when grilling on the barbecue (if I think  it needs more dry rub); if it doesnt then I store the extra for the next time I need a great barbecue rub.  This recipe also works well in the oven.  \\nWe do eat a lot of onions, and like the onion flavor in a barbecue sauce, so sometimes I add a tsp. of onion powder to the basic recipe.\\nBottom line, all in all, this is one of our very favorite recipes, and Id recommend it highly, as we use it often, especially in the summer when its nice weather  to grill. out ;)"},{"name":"country chicken chowder","steps":"skim fat from top of canned soup with paper towel', 'combine soup , chicken , onion , corn , water , milk and pepper in a large pot', 'bring just to a boil , reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes', 'ladle into serving bowls and sprinkle with parsley'","description":"i call this my cheater soup! great use for left-over chicken.","ingredients":"condensed chicken noodle soup', 'cooked chicken breast', 'onion', 'cream-style corn', 'cold water', 'evaporated skim milk', 'white pepper', 'fresh parsley'","review":"Very good stuff.It was a big hit."},{"name":"country chicken cobbler  no hassle  way","steps":"preheat oven to 400 degrees f', 'in nonstick 12-inch skillet , combine frozen vegetables , undiluted soup , milk , and pepper', 'cover and cook over medium-high heat until vegetables are thawed , stirring once', 'stir in chicken', 'transfer chicken mixture to shallow 3 1 / 2- to 4-quart casserole', 'top with biscuit quarters , leaving space between pieces', 'bake 20 to 25 minutes or until biscuits are browned and mixture is heated through'","description":"i have found that with age the desire to do everything from scratch because it's better has flown away. these days i generally look for things that are going to get me out of the kitchen...well..at least in the summer. this is a good way to get out quick. prep time is opening the packages.","ingredients":"frozen broccoli carrots cauliflower mix', 'condensed cream of potato soup', 'whole milk', 'ground black pepper', 'deli chicken', 'refrigerated buttermilk biscuits'","review":"I thought it seemed like a lot of sugar, but I followed it exact and it truly is wonderful.

Great weeknight fall back on meal. I had some cooked chicekn (leftover) and the rest was on hand. Thank GOD for this recipe bc I was in a whirlwind trying to figure out what I was going to fix with no time and no energy! I used Hatch green chili's and Hatch Green Enchilada sauce. I squeezed 1/2 a lime I had left in the fridge into the sauce to give it some 'homemade' freshness. After reading other reviews I was worried this would be lacking in flavor- NOT at all. The tang of the sour cream was strong and the green chilis added so much Pizzazz! PLEASE do make sure to add salt and pepper though. That made a HUGE difference. I also chopped one small onion and nuked in for 2 minutes in some water to cook it, then drained it and left it in the strainer until the pasta was ready. Once the pasta was drained I used the pasta pot to mix everything in before pouring into the greased pan. I then topped the casserole with some seasoned bread crumbs just to make it look prettier and to add a little crunch. It took about 30 minutes in the oven to get nicely heated through and the bread crumbs a little brown. Long enough for me to sit down and have a glass of wine- or three! lol Next time I think I will try adding some sauteed trinity (celery, onion, bell pepper) to the mix. BTW the pepper that we love to use and added a TON of great flavor here is McCormick's Pepper Blend Spice Grinder- has Black, Green, Pink peppercorns and coriander. Adds awesome flavor to lots of stuff! You came to the rescue my dear fellow Texan! Thank you so very much!

Pork is a tricky meat.  It drys out easily and its rarely tasty without great seasoning and spicing.  Especially a tenderloin which doesn't always have the same fat content as a pork chop, and therefore lacks the same juices and flavor.  This pesto had a taste, namely cilantro, but was not tasty, and unfortunately did very little to flavor this dish.  What this dish really needs is a more genuine stuffing within the pork, and this pesto should be prepared separately and poured atop the cooked meat to add more dynamic flavor.  A little bit of seasoning during prep wouldn't hurt either, to help flavor the meat.

I used a very nice organic dutch process cocoa powder, but BF and I agree that we don't think these are quite chocolatey enough. I would like them to be more cakey- they're just so thick textured (like I said before, almost like tofu). Mine also came out very thin. I like the idea of the recipe, but I also think that it needs some tinkering to be good- I think it could probably use some fat or oil and maybe use some sugar even... They were interesting and I'm glad I tried them- I think they do have potential (because they are wonderfully moist, but these do have that gummy chewy low-fat texture) but I probably wouldn't make them again... I would like to give this 3 1/2 stars, but I am going ahead and upping it to 4 because of their potential. Thanks, though! \\n**UPDATE** I found that after a couple days of sitting, the chocolate flavor intensified in these (although they still weren't as chocolatey as I would have liked).  Stored in the refrigerator thse take on a fudgier texture and less of a chewy tofy texture.  They were enjoyed!

However, the only problem is that I could not make this into pedhas! I followed steps 1 and 2 without a problem. After the mxture of khoya and sugar had formed into a soft mass, I put 8 strands of saffron into my mixer and turned the mixer on and processed until the strands broke apart into many smaller strands(about 1-2 minutes). I added these strands to the khoya-sugar mixture(I used saffron as a substitute for yellow food colour and also for authenticity) and combined it very well. I could not carry out steps 5 and 6 because the khoya-sugar mixture was really such a soft mass that it slipped out of my hands when I tried shaping it into pedhas(small balls). So, what I did was this: I transferred the mixture to a medium sized serving bowl and allowed it to cool down to room temperature. Then, I covered it and refrigerated it. It took about 3-4 hours to set into a beautiful white khoya pudding that tasted so delish I can't tell you enough in words! We all enjoyed it to the core!! Also, I made a new treat of my own - I spooned some of the sugar-khoya mixture(got in step4), over some sliced bananas and YUM! It sure tasted like heaven! I served it that way to some kids and some of them had it mixed with vanilla ice-cream. Either ways, they said it was superb! Everyone asked for the recipe.

It was very, very easy and really tasted delicious.  There was just enough for my husband and myself, but I'd consider doubling it and making it for guests anytime.
