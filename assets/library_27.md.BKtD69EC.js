I actually only had 1.5cups of almond meal/flour left, so I used about 6Tb of butter and 1tsp of Vanilla extract since I had no almond extract, and about 1/2-2/3 of an extra-large egg, and I only cooked it for about 17 min total instead of the 23 the recipe called for because I noticed the edges were already brown. As dough I thought I added too much butter because it was not as stiff as I was expecting, but it still came out crumbly, and maybe a bit dry after cooking, with a hint of sweetness. I added the rest of the egg to the rest of the dough and cooked that up for 10 minutes and they came out fluffier, almost spongy, not eggy.

I was a bit confused about all the gripes about the carb count being wrong and am speculating that the original recipe claimed 0 carbs and posters like Dee514 noted this is not true and the original author changed the carb count to the current 2.7 grams per cookie. That seems a bit high to me for a low-carb cookie but this all comes down to what you choose for the sugar substitute. For the floor, I used King Arthur Almond Flour which has 2g net carb per &frac14; cup serving times 8 for the whole batch and thus 16g total. I got about 24 cookies so 16/24 = 2/3 g net carb per cookie just for the floor. \\n\\nNow for the sugar. The author specified &frac12; cup ?Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking? which is 50% real sugar. &frac14; cup of real sugar has 50g of carb, which, divided by 24 cookies, = 2 g per cookie. Thus the total net carb per cookie = 2 2/3 g which is essentially the 2.7 stated by the author. If you choose a sugar substitute with fewer carbs, you?ll end up with a lower carb cookie. \\n\\n(A pet peeve of mine is that I wish people would specify their sugar in terms of real sugar so that I don?t have to look theirs up to convert to mine. For example in the case, ?&frac12; cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking for the equivalent sweetness of 1 cup of real sugar?)\\n\\nNow finally for my cookies ? they came out great and were enjoyed equally by both high and low carbers. I felt like experimenting and added &frac14; cup of coconut flour which gave them a bit of a coconut macaroon-like flavor. For the sugar, I used &frac12; cup of Xylitol which is a 1:1 sugar substitute but also added a couple of TBS of Truvia brown sugar blend which is a 1:2 ratio sugar substitute. I didn?t have any almond abstract so I added an extra &frac12; tsp of vanilla extract and I included the egg. I cooked as directed and they browned slightly around the edges.

I use Anthony's, and it has 2 net carbs per 1/4 cup, which would be 16 g per whole recipe. Bob's Red Mill has 2 types of almond flour, and they each have a different carb count, which is higher than Anthony's. I used granular Splenda for baking, not Splenda/sugar mix. I added a rounded tablespoons of coconut flour, because I made a half recipe, and 1 egg made the dough too wet. The cookies were good, but way too sweet, so next time, I'll halve the sugar. I accidentally put in the full amount of extracts, so that made them a little wetter and a little sweeter. Also, I'll bake them a little longer so they'll be a little crunchier. I baked them in my toaster oven, and put an almond in the center, when I flattened the first pan, but the almond fell right off. For the second pan, I flattened them before I baked them, right from the start, and the almond stuck better. The cookies got a little crispier, too. I gave the recipe 4 stars, instead of 5, because I think the baking time is a little short. The other drawbacks were my own fault, for mis-measuring, and though the Splenda is supposed to measure like sugar, I should have known that it still tastes way sweet. Next time, I'm going to add a tiny bit of xanthan gum, to see if it makes them airier, like traditional Chinese almond cookies are. I know it's baking soda that gives them the airiness, so I might experiment with that, too. Thanks for the recipe!

Mine were thicker in the middle and took longer to cook in the middle, which meant the sauce burned on the edges. It tasted really good a little burned, but these fillets were thinner than the ones I often get, and those would have been charred all over on the outside. If you only have thicker fish, I'd recommend starting to baste with the sauce halfway through cooking instead of marinating in it. This was good, even with the regular Dijon mustard. It had a nice combination of flavors and was more subtle than teriyaki.

I would serve this to company and they would not be aware that it has only 8 points. newbie04 if you had not already posted this I was going too. Update 3/12/07 I made this for dinner tonight. A few helpful hints (for the new cooks). #1 I always keep fresh ginger in saran wrap in freezer, just peel & grate what is needed. #2 Spray the tablespoon with cooking spray & the honey pours right out. #3 Most important. When broiling the salmon use the second rack from the broiler elements, after 4 minutes I move the pan to the lowest rack to finish cooking. This will prevent burning.

It's after Thanksgiving. I crammed two carcasses into my big crock pot, picked out the bones and gook and have a big bowl of stock, another of shredded turkey. I'm trying to use stuff up in the fridge but really don't want a pot of turkey soup so I used this recipe as an outline and I subbed out a few things. 1. The rice I made with turkey stock instead of water. 2. Shredded turkey instead of ground. 3. I had 2 nearly full 16 oz containers, 1 of fresh hot salsa, the other bruschetta. They sell these in the produce section. Top Crop is the name and I love their fresh regular salsa but they had been out. I left out all the diced tomato and onion and layered these in instead! 4. I had about 16 oz of vegetable juice (like V8) no one was drinking so used that instead of 2/3 of the sauce with one 8 oz can of tomato sauce. This came out so good! Some heat from the salsa but yet the sweet of the brown sugar shines through! My honey ate 2 giant bowls and I ate one and I would've ate more if I could!

I don't recall how many pounds this chicken was, but it filled  the top to the brim of my Kitchenaid Crockpot.  I allowed it to cook on high for the full 6 hours, then I lowered the temp to low and  cooked an additional 2 hours.    While the chicken was cooking, I simmered the giblets in water with onion, carrots and celery.  When the chicken was done, I removed the chicken from the crockpot. Then in a separate container added 1/2 cup of flour to enough water to make a stir-able consistency. I  then stirred this mixture into the crockpot, adding enough of my chicken broth from the giblets to make gravy. Then turned the crockpot up to high until thickened.

I would enjoy trying this with different flavors of Chex cereal, like the chocolate one. I got about 2 dozen 2 inch heart shapes out of this, but I maybe could have gotten more, if I had cut them more strategically.  I popped them in the fridge to cool before cutting and they cut really easily.

It was rather soupy and when I put them on the griddle, they wouldn't flip well. I redrained the mixture and added a 2nd egg. They worked much better that way... the egg flavor was not pronounced. But the hash browns stayed quite moist. Going forward, I don't know that I want to go the breadcrumb route since I am avoiding some of those things.... I may just add some grated potatoes (about 50%) and see how that goes.

It worked well as a night-time meal and then leftovers for lunches, though, and I liked that I could get more than one serving of vegetables and dairy (because I added more cheese) as well as whole grains and beans all in one serving of this dish. I made it without the hot sauce and tried it both with and without almonds, but I preferred the latter. Thanks for the recipe!

I did need to cook  another 1/2 cup of rice to mix in, though,since the rice kind of disappeared in the liquid (probably different brands vary, this was Uncle Bens's). I bought Hanover's Latino Blend for the veggies (corn, peppers, black beans) and loved it. I added some additional seasoning at the end, too.I thought it was great with/without the cheese, and couldn't really tell that the almonds were in there, so omit next time.
