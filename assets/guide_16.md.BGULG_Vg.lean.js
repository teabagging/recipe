We like our beef, and are very particular about it. I usually don't marinate better cuts of beef. At most I use a homemade dry rub and/or dry age them at home. Lately we have been sous viding our steaks. They turn out perfectly in terms of doneness, but even with using things that typically bring about a maillard reaction ( dusting of baking soda, sugar, etc) they still weren't browning nicely so we have been experimenting. This recipe popped up in a search. After reading the reviews, in particular from the &quot; born and bred Alberta girl&quot;, we decided to try it. We did 2 t bones, both with large tenderloin halves. We marinated both for 32 hours. 1 we grilled, 1 we sous vided then patted dry, dusted with baking soda and then did a quick super high heat grill. Both were outstanding! The tbone that we grilled was too rare for my SO but perfect for me. The sous vide steak was perfect, just lacked the smokiness of the grilled steak. This marinade definitely a winner. I have since used it for tenderloin, strip, and even a blade steak that went into the smoker. Definitely takes steaks to a whole new level!

Now that I've made it, I will change the following next time: 1) use chorizo or hot sausage -- a little spice would bring this to another level, 2) increase the apple amount -- i was scared it would be too sweet, so I was conservative with the apples but I shouldn't have been.

So here it goes.  This recipe says to use a '15' ounce 'can' of tomato paste.  Well, tomato paste does not come in a can that size, at least not here in Iowa.  I'm wondering if she meant tomato sauce which does come in a 15 ounce can.  I felt that if you would add the paste and the soup together without any other liquid it would be to thick. This  would in turn cause the mixture to  be to thick and then you could not simmer the mixture for 15 minutes without  it burning.  Keeping all this in mind, I decided on using the 15 ounces of tomato sauce.  This mixture of sauce and soup simmered nicely for the stated 15 minutes.  Next I used 9 ounces of noodles, you could even use 12 ounces without any problems.  Which I was glad, as if I used the recommended 6 ounces it would not  been enough when it came to layering the hot diah.  The last thing, there was no baking temperature stated.  So I decided on 375 degrees.  And since everything was hot already (except the cheese) I bake it for 30 minutes covered then 15 minutes uncovered, 10 would have been enough.

You can always add more water--you can't take it back out :-), (3) I realized while cooking that by the time the ingredients you add in step 8 thicken...the shrimp were going to be horribly overcooked (hello rubber bouncing balls).  I pulled the shrimp out when they were just to the slightly-underdone point, turned the heat up on the burner & reduced the sauce to a thicker consistency for a couple of minutes.  Then poured it over the shrimp in the bowl  (hot sauce = keeps cooking delicate seafood).  (4) Another Suggestion-- cut the amount of ingredients for the cheesegrits in half if you are just cooking for a couple of people.  The cheese-grit flavor is great, but it makes a TON.

But, with that being said, this recipe that follows is the closest I&#039;ve tasted that even comes close to matching up to hardees.\\n\\nYields 4-6 medium size or 3 large (about the size of actual hardees biscuits) just double or triple for more\\n\\nI&#039;ll even post the nutrition info: serving size: 1 (or 2, who&#039;s counting) per serving: 119 cal per medium or 198 calories for a large (this doesn&#039;t include the optional brushed on melted butter but just add approx. 50 calories or so if your butter is 100 per TBS)\\n\\n1 cup self rising flour (it doesn&#039;t make a huge difference but try to use White Lily or Southern Biscuit brand, your taste buds will thank you)\\n3 tablespoons original crisco vegetable shortening (you can use 4 but calorie count will go up and will need to add more confectioners sugar)\\n3 tablespoons of confectioners sugar (I know what you&#039;re thinking: yuck, sugar in biscuits? But, don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s just enough to neutralize the taste of the shortening so that you get that sweet, but savory true hardees taste!\\n1/2 cup buttermilk (whole milk and lemon juice just won&#039;t do) also, I prefer the taste of low fat but any fat content will do just fine. Also, start out using less because sometimes the flour will need less, and sometimes more.\\n \\nOkay, now preheat your oven to around 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nDirections: 1) mix flour with confectioners sugar\\n2) cut in shortening (I use a plain fork)\\n3) stir in buttermilk (making a well will help this step)\\n4) stick your dough into the freezer for around 5-10 minutes\\n5) now knead the dough 3-5 times. (I usually do 3, because it&#039;s how hardees does!)\\n6) now either pat or roll out the dough to about 1/2 inch thickness and cut out biscuits using a floured biscuit cutter\\n\\nFor soft sided biscuits, place with sides touching, for the real deal crispy hardees biscuits, place about 1 inch apart)\\n\\nNow, stick your biscuits into the oven for 10-20 minutes or until golden brown (usually it takes longer for me, because mine just don&#039;t like to brown!) \\n\\nOptional: melt 2 tablespoons of butter or margarine and brush on top of the biscuits whenever you take them from the oven.\\n\\nTips: don&#039;t be afraid to work with the dough, don&#039;t listen to what people say: honestly, the dough I work with more, usually rises more."},{"name":"fiesta dip for fritos","steps":"mix all ingredients together and serve with scoopable fritos'","description":"very yummy!","ingredients":"sour cream', 'scallion', 'sharp cheddar cheese'","review":"Baking powder listed as the last ingredient sets a person up for failure.

We all loved this recipe the addition of the onion and bacon is totally gorgeous and really adds that extra flavour to take this dish over the top. I did up the milk to 2 1/2 cups the cheese to 2 1/2 cups and used three tablespoons of flour as I was making 2 smaller cauliflowers. I also did a mix of tasty and Parmesan cheese. I was not sure where the extra bacon was supposed to go as you had it listed as add half the bacon to the onion mix and then nothing in the steps as to where the rest went. I thought maybe it was supposed to go on top with the breadcrumbs and cheese but as I was not sure if it would cook properly in the oven, I chose to add it all in with the onion mix, which worked out great. This was no biggy and did not detract from the recipe in any way. A total winner Mandy, a definite keeper and one that will be enjoyed a thousand times over in our house.

However, my BIL makes almond roca every year for the family at Christmas, he insisted it was easy. So, when I found this recipe, I pushed up my sleeves and decided I&#039;d give it a try. The store didn&#039;t have anything but sliced almonds, which I didn&#039;t like the looks of, so I bought crushed pecans, otherwise I followed the direction exactly. The mixture took a long time to come to temperature, (I used a candy thermometer), the better part of 45 minutes, but I have a new electric stove, and I was increasing the heat by one increment at a time. This really does need a med or better heat level, it really does turn the color of a paper bag. I used salted butter and white sugar, and poured the mixture into a lasagna sized, buttered, disposable aluminum pan. This worked perfectly, as I don&#039;t think the recipe said what size of vessel to use. I melted the chocolate chips in a bowl over boiling water. Once everything was in the pan, we set it out in the garage over night, 40 degrees or so. This morning, we had roca to rival my BIL&quot;s! It came out easily, and is perfect in every way!

I found that in using a spray oil on the cookie sheet that it left a film on the bottom of the toffee, so I had to blot each piece with a paper towel. On the first batch, I scored into the toffee, but only part way. When inverting the pan to release the candy, it broke into irregular shapes so I just went with that. Also a Lot of the nut topping was displaced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So on batch #2 I scored deeply into the toffee, and also lightly tapped the almond topping into the chocolate after sprinkling. Once again, the toffee just broke where it wanted to though so I have no clue what the point of the scoring is. That WAS helpful to pat the almonds into the chocolate so they more readily stay put (but a Lot still come loose when inverting). I also decided to add 1/4&quot; tsp. of almond extract to the toffee mixture, something I often like to add to recipes. To me, it &quot;cuts&quot; the sweetness a tad and definitely adds to the finished taste which is yummy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also -- since it was bizarrely missing from the orignal recipe -- the baking pan I used measures15&quot; X 10&quot; and was the ideal size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will I make it again [someday]? ....Yup.

So, my mother made this pot roast recipe yesterday for my birthday / Easter Sunday dinner. It was delicious and we all enjoyed it very much! I can honestly say this was the BEST pot roast recipe I've ever had so far! We did make few modifications though. For starters, here in Florida, it's difficult to find &quot;small new potatoes&quot; and &quot;Yukon potatoes&quot; So, we used Baby Yellow Dutch Potatoes instead - they cooked very well and tasted wonderful with the sauce. Also, we decided to omit adding the cornstarch to the sauce - since we wanted the sauce to be more of a light broth consistency. And, we found a recipe for a Cajun / Creole spice mixture which we decided to make and combine with this recipe - again, it turned out great. Lastly, we added extra mushrooms, onions, carrots, and Baby Yellow Dutch potatoes (since I LOVE all of these veggies) - since we omitted adding cornstarch to the sauce, all of the extra veggies were able to cook thoroughly in the light broth. We served this pot roast with fresh Chicago hard rolls and poppy-seed silver dollar rolls. I'm planning to buy some ciabatta rolls to sandwiches with the leftover pot roast. All in all, I absolutely LOVED this recipe and I would love to make it again.

To clarify a couple of things for the new user....I learned this by trial and error this morning....1) You can make this without a machine with a paddle. I mixed for about 4 minutes using a stiff spatula, so use your imagination. 2) I used stone ground soy flour (it&#039;s what I happened to have on hand) - a little chewier than finer ground, but it worked, 3) KEEP YOUR FINGERS MASSIVELY FLOURED - this is super sticky. You don&#039;t have to handle it a LOT, but you&#039;ll be washing your hands a lot otherwise. If your hands get sticky, it doesn&#039;t work to just re-flour your hands - the dough just sticks more. 4) I used a full cup of oil, it didn&#039;t cover the full bottom of the pan, 5) I put the small dough ball in pan and flattened it with a floured spatula, or try your fingers. It saved me a lot of dough. Flatten it to about 1/8 or 1/4 inch, the thinner you can get it the better you might like it, otherwise it&#039;s about the thickness/density of a crispy pancake.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope this helps you. It has a really nice texture, reminds me of an oven biscuit. I used onion powder, but I think it might even work with a sweeter product like vanilla powder or cinnamon.

This helps for just about all baking instances. For this recipe, I also added some Torelli's raspberry syrup for some of the red color & a touch more raspberry flavor.
