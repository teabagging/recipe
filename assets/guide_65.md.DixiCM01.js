And the aroma from the crushed seeds incredible. I put the  cumin seeds in a plastic bag and used a rolling pin to crush them. The coriander seeds were a little more difficult to crush since they are flat to begin with. I think a meat tenderizer or mortar and pestle would do the trick though.<br/><br/>Simply covering the chickpeas with water was not really enough to simmer for a full hour (I used a regular-sized saucepan), so I would recommend double the quantity as one would do with rice.  I had to add more water half way through cooking, but they still softened without any trouble.<br/><br/>I put a tsp. of olive oil on the baking pan and used a paper towel to distribute it evenly. If I put a little on my hands, I could have rolled each falafel just as easily, or used an olive oil spray to a fine mist once they were on the pan, but I'm watching my dietary oil consumption and it wasn't really necessary to add flavor, since the onion, garlic and spices are already very aromatic. Greasing either the pan or the falafel is necessary however so they don't stick.<br/><br/>I found everything to hold pretty well together. I used the pure setting on my food processor. Just use a delicate touch when rolling them and you should be fine.<br/><br/>I forgot to flatten them slightly, so they were just round, but that was pretty much as I expected them. Excluding this step didn't seem to affect the final result.<br/><br/>I made a little persian salad/salsa to go with them. Fresh cut roma tomatoes, onions, and another half cup of parsley made for a delicious topping. Add a little humus and mmmmm!

This is such a creative use of the contest ingredients.

The taste of the cake is 5 stars for sure - and as everybody else I loved the streusel and the rum glaze, well done! The reason why I rate this recipe 4 stars and not 5 is that I wouldn't bother buying plantains for this cake if I made it again.

Kittencal's recipe is great as written, but for anyone who had the idea to store in the fridge like I did, I want to warn you of the dangers.  Botulism can occur when garlic and oil are combined and kept at room temperature (also warnings are given about storing in the fridge).

I remember, when I was younger, my Mom going through the long process of soaking cucumbers for days in one kind of solution, then washing them and soaking them in sugar to make sweet pickles.  Wow, if she had known about this, I wonder if she would have gone through all that trouble.  I was a little skeptical about the hot sauce, but it gives the pickles a nice kick.  I may reduce the amount next time, just to have a more traditional sweet pickle.  Oh, I also didn't have any garlic cloves, so I just put in the equivalent of garlic powder.  It tastes great to me.  Note: it only makes enough liquid to cover about 1/2 of the pickles, so you need to keep them shaken up.  I highly recommend you give this recipe a try.  Thanks Jan for submitting it!!  *Update*  I've made another jar, but this time only used a few drops of hot sauce.  My boys and I like these a lot better.

I use my bread machine dough cycle to make the dough.  We have used this recipe for our Christmas morning cinnamon rolls for the past two years.  I tend to make my rolls quite large, so they do have to be cooked a bit longer and covered with foil at some point to prevent overcooking the tops of them.  Depending on how pressed for time I am, I will either make a frosting to go on these, or sometimes I'll just cheat and top them with some cream cheese frosting purchased from the store.  I find it only takes half a tub (or less) of frosting if using store-bought, so I just freeze the rest of the frosting for the next time I make cinnamon rolls.  Often, I'll feel guilty for sabotaging my diet with something so full of calories and fat, but these cinnamon rolls are so good that I don't even feel guilty occasionally having them.  They are worth every calorie, making this a satisfying splurge!  I don't make these too often, as we usually try to stick to healthier fare for breakfast; however, whenever something special is to be celebrated (holidays, graduations, etc.), these are what always gets made at our house.

We normally make spaghetti with meat sauce, so DH was skeptical of this. We both enjoyed it a great deal though. I made some small substitutions--canned plum tomatoes instead of fresh, since the fresh ones didn't look so hot (I used two 28 oz cans and pureed them in the food processor), and I used beef broth instead of the water/bouillon cube combo. I tasted the sauce once it was done, and liked it a lot, but then I added some brown sugar like you had suggested (maybe 2 tbsp?) and let it simmer another 10 minutes or so. Both ways were great, so it really just depends on what you like. I think next time I will add some mushrooms to this for a heartier sauce.

The taste is actually quite nice, but you have to love honey and not eat more than one piece per evening. As for the melted butter, I recommend using butter (or other fat) that solidifies quite quickly (so definitely no oil), it makes it very easy to assemble the layers of phyllo pastry. The fat will form a protective layer while assembling the pastry and the pastry won't get soft.

I did do some subs but feel that these subs did not alter the taste, but then again maybe they did.  I did not have any ricotta and subbed in some cottage cheese and left out the speghetti sauce, none to be had.  I also fixed them slightly different and had great success.  I did not precook the zuchs, i just cut them in half and using a small spoon scraped and twisted out the seeds and middle to make a boat.  I then added the scraped out middle to the recipe after i chopped it roughly.  Since the recipe did not call for the scrape out in the ingredients i added some additional cracker crumbs to absorb the moisture.  I filled the boats and put them in a sprayed pan and poured in a tab of water to help cook my raw squash.  I added the parmesean to the filling, covered and baked about 30 mins. Then uncovered and spread with cheddar cheese and finished baking until golden.  YUMMY.  I will fix this again and I will also fix it again using the speghetti sauce when i have it.
