I planned to chop up some pineapple slices to grill along with the swordfish and prepared the salsa. Unfortunately, I never got to the party because I had a bad skin reaction after cutting up the jalapeno pepper and removing the seeds. Please, if you make this recipe, be very careful and make sure you wear gloves when cutting up the jalapeno. (I used a green aromatic variety from my local farmer&#039;s market.) If I had been at home, I would have likely taken the time to research how to properly deseed a jalapeno before attempting, but I was at a family member&#039;s guest house when preparing this and didn&#039;t have direct internet access, so I made the mistake of just going for it sans research. Boy was that the mistake of my life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We were kind of nervous to try the salsa after my fingertips being in burning pain for three hours, so when we finally had the swordfish it was broiled in our oven at home and without the benefit of the salsa flavoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I make this again I will just leave out the jalapeno, because I think the salsa would have been quite delicious, especially since I used fresh organic pineapple and orange. Without the benefit of that, it needed some salt, and the fish was slightly bland for me, but the citrus marinade adds a nice flavor to it. I would recommend using a flat dish or plastic ziplock not a bowl for better coverage, and maybe add some garlic salt.

I only strained for 3 hours, and I'm guessing the full 12 hours would make the final product more crumbly and less ricotta-like (either way, I'd be happy).

The presentation was gorgeous, and my dinner guests absolutely LOVED it.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of all kinds of ways to use this.

We love trying new and unique kiev' recipes and this one did not dissapoint! The flavor is truly superb!

I also prepared it a little different. I blended the seasonings all together into softened butter (traditional kiev). I floured the breast pieces first, then placed the seasoned butter onto the meat, followed with a light dusting of more flour. I then rolled them up and used toothpicks to hold them together. The recommendation of freezing them while the pan heats up works great. I used an oven proof skillet saving me from washing an additional pan. They took 30 minutes in the oven.

While I did really enjoy the flavors of this dish and will certainly try again, I had a few problems with the dish which on reflection I should have anticipated. The amount of liquid was excessive for the type of rice i choose and showed in the final results . Cooked my pot for 25 minutes and still had a good amount of starchy liquid left so I cooked an additional 3 minutes turned off the pot and let it sit another 5. While the liquid was gone, the rice was rather mushy and a little sticky. I would suggest going by the amount of liquid on your packaging and adjusting the total amount of liquid and cooking time accordingly. The flavors here are really delicious and worth the effort. I do like scallions and included them in my dish - glad they were mentioned in the intro.  My peppers were a combination of red, yellow and green which match well in color and flavor.  My only change to the seasoning was to add 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger to a half batch of the recipe -- which I thought balanced the sweetness of the catsup and brown sugar nicely.  Thanks!

The 4 cups of rhubarb only filled  the 8x8 pan 1/4 of the way up the side in it&#039;s raw state. Once cooked there would have been maybe 1/2 an inch of filling. I went and cut 4 more stalks which gave me close to 7 cups and raised the rhubarb level to about 2/3 up the side of the pan and, of course, I need to increase the other ingredients that went into the filling. Also not mentioned in the recipe is a sitting time (30 mins for me) to allow the sugar (I used a sugar - Splenda mix -1/4 sugar to 3/4 Splenda) to draw out the juice. That&#039;s important because it keeps the filling from being dry and the thickened juice is an excellent part of a crisp. There is also way to much sugar in the topping for us so I used 1/4 cup Splenda Brown and 1/4 cup Splenda. I use Splenda because I&#039;m diabetic but it measures and sweetens exactly like sugar and I would use the same changes if I were using sugar.

It was my daughter's favorite item from Luby's when we lived in Texas.  After moving she longed for her Luby's chocolate pie.  Thank goodness I found the recipe.  It has been a family favorite for at least a dozen years every Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I've shared this recipe over & over.  Note to one of the reviewers, you don't use the marshmallows as a topping, they are mixed into the warm custard.  That's what gives it the unique Luby's taste unlike any other chocolate pie.  I always use graham cracker crust.  Also, I temper the egg mixture with a little warm chocolate mixture before adding it to the hot chocolate mixture.  Another tip is to place Sarah wrap on top of the pie to cool.  This will prevent a skin from forming.
