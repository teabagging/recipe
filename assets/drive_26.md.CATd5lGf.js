To Make Stuffing: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When foam subsides add onion and saute, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Stir in celery and apples; saute (without browning) about 5 minutes longer. Scrape skillet contents into a large mixing bowl. Add bread crumbs, ground pork, sausage meat, parsley, sage, salt and pepper. Mix together gently but thoroughly. (Note: Do not taste the uncooked stuffing, for it contains raw pork; instead, fry a small ball of the stuffing in the skillet, then taste and season with more salt and pepper as necessary). Fill the center of the crown with the stuffing, mounding it slightly. Cover it with a round of aluminum foil and wrap the ends of the chop bones in strips of foil to prevent them from charring and snapping off. Place the crown on a rack in a shallow roasting pan just large enough to hold it comfortably, and roast in the center of the oven, undisturbed, for about 3 hours or until internal temperature of meat is 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). (Note: 30 minutes before pork is done, remove the foil from the top of the stuffing to allow the top to brown.) Carefully transfer the crown to a large, heated, circular platter, strip the foil from the ends of the chops and replace it with paper frills. Let the crown rest for about 10 minutes before carving and serving. To Carve Pork: Insert a large fork in the side of the crown to steady it and, with a large, sharp knife, cut down through each rib to detach the chops.

I went to my local butcher shop and got a package of authentic Irish banger sausage. For the recipe, I pan-fried my sausages, then removed them as noted, to saut\\\\xe9 the onions, which I did for somewhat less than the five minutes suggested, because we like them to still be crunchy, so long enough just to heat them through. Also, I never buy canned gravy, so I made some pan gravy. I removed the onions from the skillet, added some beef stock that I had in the fridge to and brought that to a boil while stirring with the juices still in the pan. I gradually sprinkled in a bit of Wondra flour to thicken it up just a little and then dropped the onions back into the mixture and stirred everything together. I let the whole thing simmer for another 8-10 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes. I prefer to mix the onions into the gravy to give the gravy more of a flavor kick. For the potatoes, I did not add the chicken bouillon; rather, i drizzled a little bit of the beef stock in while I was mashing. When I had mashed the potatoes done and plated, I added the sausage on the potatoes and ladled the gravy mixture over everything.
