I cut the yeast back to 1 tablespoon (candida scares me) used 1 cup of arrowroot to replace 1 of the cups of tapioca (tapioca binds with and removes calcium) and raw apple cider vinegar instead of the lemon juice. I baked it in an 8 inch cake pan because I was using it for stuffing. It turned out extremely well. The texture is like a really good sour dough bread and the taste is divine. I will use this recipe for foccocia, stuffing and subs from now on. \\nThanks again."},{"name":"easy mocha   mochaccino  de caf is possible if wanted","steps":"put in hot chocolate powder& cappuccino powder put in hot water and stir till dissolved', 'put infolgers instant coffee single , and dunk until flavor is reached', 'take out instant coffee single and serve'","description":"this was a recipe that i just threw a bunch of things in and drank it on the go, then modified later.","ingredients":"instant cappuccino mix', 'hot chocolate powder', 'instant coffee', 'hot water'","review":"Made these as mini-meatballs & almost just doubled the recipe instead of doing that!

This turned out great.  I love roasted veggies already but this sauce really kicked it up a notch.  I used all of the roasted garlic in the sauce but left out the olive oil as we are not used to eating that much oil.  I don't think that hurt the recipe at all.  We just sprayed the veggies with olive oil spray and didn't use any in the sauce but added a bit of water so it would coat all the veggies.  The horseradish was not that strong- just enough to give it a little kick. Thanks for posting, I would make it again.

Let your child touch the food, help him to play with the food. Allow him to take his fingers to his mouth. So eating, eating, eating should be as enjoyable as playing a game. Small colored plates, heart-shaped breakfast plates, prepared lunches such as picnicking, dinner prepared like playing house, can be transformed into a pleasurable event made with family. It seems difficult for mothers and fathers to give their children food in front of television. Instead they need to turn off the television. Friv needs to find solutions that will increase interest and desire. For example, funny facial shapes, simple games such as airplane flying, eating games for toddlers, interesting and entertaining to eat contribute to your child's movement and cognitive development. When your child is hungry, he can feel grumpy and cry without any reason. Most of the time, these reactions are outdoors. It is necessary to evaluate this reaction well and encourage the child to eat. Can children who do not eat food add a habit of eating with the game? Of course, the game at friv 2 is very important for the development of a child. However, the game should be applied up to 2 years of age. The game can be cooked until 2 years of age, after which the game is not suitable for eating and eating habits. Because we can apply certain rules, we have to give this habit to the child from their early ages. It is an important role model for the child to eat together with the family, to sit in the table together. Even if you have not eaten your food, sitting in the family cafeteria is important for the development of the child. It is best not to make your meal times boring. This is also very important in terms of communication with children. A child who does not eat will want to have a loud tone and different and abrasive expressions will be used. I think it is also important in terms of food. You can make your child's dinner sessions more engaging at some point. But do not take it to the point of a child who opens your mouth like a robot in every advertising cycle, sitting in front of friv unblocked video-recorded ads."},{"name":"easy potatoes that rock sox","steps":"stab the potato with a fork or knife', 'put the potato in the microwave for 5-7 minutes', 'cut the potato in half and mash it up with a fork', 'add toppings in whichever order you would like', 'enjoy ! :d'","description":"","ingredients":"potato', 'american cheese', 'butter', 'rosemary', 'garlic salt'","review":"This is really good!
