I felt the sourdough flavor really overpowered the other flavors. It wasn't near as good as similar coffeecakes that use sour cream or buttermilk in the batter. \\nThe recipe itself also needs some tweaking. The title refers to pecans but there aren't any mentioned in the recipe itself. I added 1/3 cup to the topping mixture. Even though I beat it for 3+ minutes it never got light. The batter was really more like a sticky dough. The instructions mention you can bake it in a 13x9-inch pan or an angel food pan but then only say bake for 30 minutes. I used an angel food cake pan and I knew there was no way it would be done in 30 minutes & it wasn't. It took 55 minutes. It was edible and very moist, but I doubt I'll ever make it again.

The changes I had to make were 1) homemade lemon pepper (combined dried lemon zest and ground pepper corn) 2) no white shoepeg corn, and 3)  only one can of green chilies.  I definitely think another can of green chilies would give it the extra zing it needs but we are glad we even tucked one in our suitcase last time we returned from the States.   The recipe is worth me learning how to make my own homemade chilies.  We also used a local cheese to top it with.  Thanks for a great easy and delicious recipe.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, as that's how good they were. To spice up the bars a bit more, I added 1/2 teaspoon each, of ground ginger and ground cloves, after all, that's the other two spices found in a pumpkin pie, and since this is made w/canned pumpkin, I thought those two spices would work well in this recipe. When I made the frosting, I found I had to add 8 Tablesponns of the maple syrup, but I also think one could add 9 if need be. The next time I make these bars tho, I'm also going to add a 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of Maple Flavoring to the frosting to give it a bit more of maple flavor. I'm not sure how many nuts I topped these bars with; I just sprinkled on how much I wanted, and I lightly tapped them into the frosting with the tips of my fingers, so they would not fall off when removing from the pan. One other thing I wanted to mention here, I found this recipe makes 24 bars rather than 45.

It was a very moist cake, with a different texture - most similar to very moist corn breads, but different, too.  It smelled heavenly!  The recipe didn't specify what kind of orange to use; I used a navel and though the flavor was fine, I wouldn't consider it very orange.  Perhaps another kind of orange would flavor it more strongly.  I did add a few spoons of OJ to help in processing the orange.  Also, the pan size or type was not specified, and not knowing what to expect about rising, I baked it in a 9x9 glass dish.  Although thin, I baked it just over 30 minutes, and the top was barely turning golden but it seemed done anyway.  This cake doesn't rise very much, so an 8x8 would probably work, but it would probably need longer to bake.  This cake was really fun to make; I loved the idea of processing the orange whole.  But, in the end, although I thought it was OK, I probably wouldn't make it the same way again.

I was curious to try it after seeing the simplicity and only requiring 4 ingredients. I took the previous review into account and decided to use a nice big Valencia orange since navel oranges tend to have a weaker flavor IMO. First, I pulverized the orange in the food processor then added a little Odwalla orange juice, just eyeballing it, and had a perfect orange compound. Then I beat the eggs and sugar together in a separate bowl until foamy. I used Recipe #5247 using my own homemade arrowroot baking powder, then put it in the food processor with the egg-sugar mixture, and let it whir for about a minute. I poured it into my 9.5 inch Pyrex pie pan that I greased with canola oil and dusted with flour and let it bake for 35 minutes-- the edges turned golden to perfection and made the whole kitchen smell like oranges! Interestingly, once it cooled a bit the edges started to move away from the pan a bit. It tastes wonderful with some tart frozen plain yogurt and a nice cup of black tea.

And no, I don&#039;t mean window licking, helmet wearing denizens of the short bus special, though they do have their moments (how do I know?  I have one too - and he has THUMBS!...)  I just popped my picnic shoulder into the fridge and will be back to review (and give stars) once I pop that baby out of the crockpot!  Update:  OMG - This did NOT disappoint!!!  It is the BEST pulled pork recipe I have tried (or eaten for that matter!!!)  I used Chris &amp; Pitts BBQ sauce and added a couple of ADDITIONAL teaspoons of cumin + a little shallot powder (about 1tsp) and off I went.  Did I forget to mention I used half a head of freshly minced garlic AND the powder?  I LOVE garlic!  This was SO GOOD if I could give it 10 stars I would.  It is the first pulled pork that wasn&#039;t over the top sweet or too spicy for me (no folks, I&#039;m not afraid of some spice but there is a point when it becomes about the spice and is then no longer about the flavor).  (Oh!  I used sweet (not really sweet, it&#039;s just what they call it - it&#039;s not the spicy one) smoked paprika rather than regular, it&#039;s my favorite, I like the smoky flavor).  When we ran out of bread, we added avocado and ate it on tortillas the next day - this is the BOMB DIGGITY!  Thank you Kittencal!

I do not add the barbecue sauce at the beginning. I simply let the roast cook away on its own, no added liquid necessary. [Extra edit: Another helpful tweak. If you have the time, OMIT the vegetables at this stage. I suggest sauteeing the onions and peppers separately. This way, they don't just dissolve after cooking for so long.] After shredding the meat, and draining away some of the extra juices (leave some of the liquid so the pork doesn't get dry!) I'll put the meat back into the crock pot, finally add the barbecue sauce (I do not add sugar), [add the sauteed vegeteables at this point as well] and then let it warm through.

So rich and delicious!  I was so anxious to make this because it looked so yummy that I skipped over reading reviews! I originally took out dried cranberries, then by looking at pic#1 posted by Derf I saw they used fresh cranberries~ so glad I had them hanging in freezer! I placed in a loaf pan and baked 10 minutes less because I didn't think the batter was enough for my bundt pan.  Other poster recommended doubling batch and then baking in a bundt pan~ I should of read this first.  Also, since this is a KEEPER---I will add about 1/2 cup more cranberries as well as add chopped walnuts in the future~~just personal preference.
