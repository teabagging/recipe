This recipe is a 10-star for sure.  I was curious how tofu ricotta would taste and it was so delicious, lighter than milk ricotta and bursting with flavor from all its ingredients.  My only mistake was thinking I could cut the beets thin enough with a super-sharp knife.  I cooked two beets just to be sure I could get enough thin slices but I only ended up with 7-8 that I could roll.  I took the other slices and assembled them oreo-style, putting filling inside two slices.  They turned out just fine and it's a good alternative if someone doesn't have a mandoline. The tempura gave just the right amount of crunch without covering up the flavor of the rollatinis, and the glaze was perfect and added just a touch of sweetness.  I had to make the glaze twice -- the first time I was assembling the rolls at the same time, and it quickly went from being slightly syrupy to too sticky and thick to drizzle, so the second time I gave it my full attention and got it off the heat just as it was thickening.  It did take me longer than the stated time to get this from start to finish, but it was worth it.  I'll be serving this next time with a main dish that doesn't take a lot of attention, such as a roast, which will free up plenty of time to make these.

I used basmati rice (not instant or minute rice) that I had soaked all day in water. Added it and the tomatoes to cook for a final hour.  The basmati soaked up the liquid and had a lovely flavor.

I made a tweak of course because while Chevy's salsa is amazing it is very mild.  I use either two or three jalape?o peppers and add a Serrano to give it some heat to go along with the flavor. I also reduce the salt. I have also found it helpful to brush the vegetables with olive oil or toasted sesame oil prior to grilling them.  This adds to the smoke flavor."},{"name":"martha stewart s mary dillion praline cookies","steps":"preheat oven to 375', 'have ready two clean baking sheets', 'spread pecans on a rimmed baking pan , and toast in the oven until golden -- about 10 minutes', 'set aside to cool', 'reduce temperature to 350', 'sift flour , baking powder , and salt in a medium bowl', 'set aside', 'in the bowl , of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment , beat butter and 1 1 / 2 cups light brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy', ', about 2 minutes', 'add egg and vanilla , beat on low speed until combined', 'drop batter by level tablespoons onto baking sheets , about 2 apart', 'bake until firm and barely golden , 10-12 minutes , rotating halfway through', 'transfer to a wire rack to cool 5 minutes on baking sheets', 'remove cookies from baking sheet and transfer to wire rack until completely cool', 'in a small saucepan , combine remaining 1 1 / 4 cups light brown sugar and cream and bring to a full boil over medium heat', 'cook , stirring constantly , about 1 minute', 'remove from heat', 'working quickly , add confectioners sugar and whisk until smooth', 'add pecan pieces and stir until slightly thickened', 'if mixture thickens , return to heat and add cream 1 tsp at a time', 'spoon tsp on each cookie and set aside until firm'","description":"this wonderful recipe from martha stewart is so very good...","ingredients":"pecan halves', 'all-purpose flour', 'baking powder', 'table salt', 'butter', 'light brown sugar', 'egg', 'pure vanilla extract', 'heavy cream', confectioners' sugar]","review":"I don't care for the burnt taste of Chevy's salsa.

If you like Chevy&#039;s salsa, you also don&#039;t like too much heat in your salsa. I made the recipe exactly to this and found it a bit salty, but the saltiness subsided after a couple of hours. I&#039;ve been using 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt because I  like to eat the salsa fresh and warm. Makes 32 ounces. I love Chevy&#039;s salsa but my wife doesn&#039;t like the smokey flavor of it all. Broiled, this is perfect for her. Grilled (On the BBQ) was too smokey for her (But smelled GREAT!) Much like Reeser&#039;s Restaurant-style salsa, too, which disappeared from our stores which prompted me to find this recipe. For less heat, use smaller peppers. For more, use bigger peppers. Adding or subtracting a whole pepper is too much, either way. Oh... I also use the ripest Roma tomatoes that I could find. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To compare costs VS buying salsa, I used the 16 ounce tub. Each 16 ounces costs me about $1.22 in ingredients. The whole batch was $2.44. So, my time was worth the savings versus store bought fresh salsa, but I just had a hard time keeping the family stocked with this stuff.

I can attest to the forgiving nature of the recipe. I used 3 large leeks (and even included lots of the darker green parts because they do have nice flavor, the dark green looks great in this soup, and because they aren't too tough after a good simmer). I used extra garlic, less stock, and skipped the beans altogether because I didn't think we would like that texture with the thicker type of soup. I used turkey pepperoni slices in place of bacon, and used 2 cans (didn't have a 3rd) of pumpkin rather than the squash--partly for convenience, but also because I've found that pumpkin strikes me as less sweet than the other orange/yellow squashes and I prefer that. I had no tarragon, so used extra thyme and added some sage, as well as plenty of pepper. I did not use the cream and we did not miss it. I served it with some parmesan cheese and fresh bread and salad. It had great flavors that both contrasted from each other and worked well together, and I also really enjoyed the leftovers in my lunch.

All that was left was a noodle stuck to the side of the dish. The only difference in the recipe were two things. I sliced the zucchini summer squash on the mandolin, sliced about 1/4 thick. The reason for that? I neglected to read, (or maybe it's old age ?) that the zucchini and squash should be in 1 1/2 inch chunks. Well chalk this up to the heat, but they still turned out beautifully. Nice ribbons of zucchini, grilled to perfection. I put these and some grilled onions right into the pasta and melded the tastes together. Just wonderful, mikekey~will make this again soon.

They are definatly going to replace my current chaneh recipe that go with bhatooras. I made this today for my anti-chicken-eating husband and he loved them! A difference that I made was that i used one can of garbanzo beans instead of soaking a cup overnight.  I also didn't use asofetida because I didn't have any, and instead of ghee I just used a some oil.\\nWe had these with parathas but next time we will have these with some bhatooras.\\nAhhh soooo good :)\\nCharishma, ur recipes are awesome.

It's been a while since I had the noodles at P.F. Chang, but they sure taste similar to what I remember.  Nice and spicy!\\nI had to make a few modifications since I was out of some items.  I only used 2 chicken thighs that were already cooked from a previous meal.  I diced them up and added at the cabbage step.  I also didn't have shrimp but added a handful of peanuts to give it some more bulk.  I used more shredded cabbage to help thin out the noodles a bit and used an extra squirt of Sriracha Hot Sauce in place of 1T of the Ketchup.  I also used the white part of the scallions and sliced them thin and sauteed them with the cabbage.  I omitted the cilantro as I'm not a fan and didn't end up using the limes (was too excited to eat!)  I also used a handful of broccoli slaw instead of the carrot since that's what we had in the fridge.

I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks so much to Sue for sharing this recipe!!!  Oh, I would make the suggestion to use 8 oz of boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of the breast meat.

By the time you get to seeing this review, I pray and sincerely hope you are in great health. This cake is truly good. I did not do the icing as we don't use cream cheese(weight loss!)and didn't have it on hand. I halved the recipe for the cake and made it in my AMC Dutch Oven. It took 1 hour 15minutes to bake. The cake was on the less sweet side. This was the biggest reason for its success, I think. The external auditor of the company dad is working for came over to dad's office this evening and I sent half the cake to the office for the guys to eat and enjoy. The auditor had 5 huge pieces and really praised it to the skies. He said he has made up his mind not to have dinner at home, and, kept picking up piece after piece of the cake:)\\nI nibbled on the crumbs that kept falling off when I was slicing the cake.
