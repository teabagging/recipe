I am not sure exactly how to correct this for the next time I use the mix. I think less cooking time, more butter, more water (used to make the paste), or the addition of plain yogurt as I have seen for other recipes - not sure which I will try first.

For years I've been trying different turkey burger recipes and they always left me just wanting a good ol' hamburger instead. I'm happy to announce that this recipe surpassed my high expectations for a turkey burger. It is delicious, full of flavor and pretty darn healthy, too! Notes: 1.When reading grill seasoning in the recipe, I would have ordinarily used a chicken grill seasoning BUT since JanuaryBride had noted that she used a steak seasoning, I decided to give that I try. I believe it's a KEY ingredient. The black pepper and mixture of spices in the steak seasoning (I used 'Montreal Steak Seasoning') hit the perfect flavor notes with the turkey. 2. I used a stoneground mustard vs. dijon and it was perfect for this recipe. 3. Definitely follow the directions in terms of toasting the english muffins OR buns. It does make a difference. *I used toasted whole wheat buns. 4.

All my life I&#039;ve loved this special treat in our family.  While my mom would make it any time of the year its something that is a MUST on the Easter dinner table.  This is very close to our family recipe and the only reason I didn&#039;t give it five stars is that I think it would be even better with more coconut.  A hint for others, we don&#039;t use saltine crackers, we use what are called &quot;oyster crackers&quot; which obviously, are make to eat in oyster stew.  I&#039;ve also have ALWAYS wondered the origin of this recipe as no one has ever heard of it despite living in an area where lots of Pennsylvania Dutch recipes exist. But this one, somehow only my family seems to attached themselves to this.  My own side of the family comes from the Lancaster area through the Mennonites so we have lots of their classic foods.

It means ?Waterfall? and can also describe a meat soup, but most typically refers to the meat salad. The salad is also enjoyed by the Lao people.\\n\\nI will be making this tonight. I?m glad I ran across this recipe because I was trying to figure out what to do with this sirloin tip steak I?ve had in the freezer. I can?t believe this wasn?t the first thing I thought of, I?ve been making Num Tok for at least 6 years now.\\n\\nThis is a great basic recipe although I offer these few suggestions to folks who are trying this for the first time.\\n\\n1-Unless you are fond of bland food (I mean no offence,  A LOT of people eat bland food because they can?t handle powerful flavors and spices and the salt paranoia of late has people making tragically unsalted dishes) I recommend seasoning the meat. At least salt and pepper, and if you are grilling, don?t oil the meat, oil the grill grate. (Just my opinion, oil lets too much of the spice fall off when grilling. Kitchenmaniac has no seasoning in this recipe, so if you go that route, oiling the meat is just fine.)\\n\\nA nice perforating of the meat with a fork or better yet a culinary needler, also called a tenderizer and a few hours in a marinade that is similar or just like the sauce in this recipe will amp this recipe up nicely.\\n\\n2-The Kaffir and mint leaves are a bit out of the usual. No problem using them but I can?t stand Kaffir lime leaf for some reason except a little bit in a red curry paste and a touch in a Tom Yum Goong soup.\\n\\nThis mint in this recipe would be replaced with Thai basil more traditionally in my experience. Use the mint for mojitos!\\n\\n3-Grilling the chilies a little bit will alter their flavor in a good way. Do this ahead of time and pop them in the fridge to make them cool.\\n\\nIf you really like Thai level heat, mince one or two (depending on the punishment you deserve) Thai hot peppers in to the dressing (Also often called bird?s eye chilies). They are nuclear like habaneros but like habaneros are to Mexican food they have a distinct flavor only a Thai hot can give.\\n\\nAlmost any variety of vegetable would be good with this salad. Broccoli and cauliflower would be a bit weird I think but I would use tomato, cucumber, julienned or shredded carrot, shredded or finely cut cabbage or baby bok choy?even fresh squash like yellow or zucchini thinly cut or julienned if I had on hand. May be a step out of traditional, but delicious.\\n\\n4-The dressing is straight up the mother?s milk of Thai style sauces and can be used for dipping Thai summer rolls in, instead of or along with the typical peanut sauce typically served with summer rolls, but add a little water for use as a dip to soften it a bit.\\n\\nAlso, I tend to not use as much sugar. Thai restaurants sweeten dishes for the America palette just like Chinese places do. They don?t really eat everything so sweet and they do not sprinkle peanuts over everything. Play around with the balance of ingredients for the sauce and you?ll get it just right for you. You may like sweet, but not me?not for dinner at least. This recipe is pretty much straight down the line what you will read all over and is tried and true though.\\n\\nProps to KitchenManiac for not sprinkling peanuts all over this salad. Peanuts, contrary to a lot of people?s thinking does not make dishes ?Thai?. There are a few Thai dishes peanuts are called for?a FEW. This is not one of them.\\n\\n5-Finally, it is traditional to sprinkle a little ground roasted rice on this salad. Roast uncooked rice in a pan or toaster oven just until they begin to turn yellowish/light brown then finely grind in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Make a batch and it keeps for a very long time on the spice shelf/rack. The texture this adds is something you?ll be sorry you have missed all this time?for most people at least?your mileage may vary.\\n\\nI LOVE NUM TOK!

It looked so good, so I asked my mom to check out the recipe and see if she thought it would be good and she said it looked like a good one, so we set up a work station and began making this relish.  We hand ground all the tomatoes, onions and peppers, and it took some time, but it was fun working with my mom.  We let the stuff sit for the 5 hours and watched TV and then made some cookies in the meantime.  When the relish was ready to can, we finished up the process, and canned 12 jars.  I used the relish for the first time today when we made Recipe #251957 and decided to grill some hot dogs and burgers.  Let me tell you, this relish was just as good on the burgers as they were on the hot dogs!  I had 2 dogs and 1 burger :)  Everyone was scrambling for the relish once they had their first one.  It is the perfect condiment for hot dogs, hamburgers, alongside beans and hot dogs, to use in potato or pasta salad.  Oh, there are so many ways this can be used, and I can't wait to experiment with this!  Such yummy relish and so much better than store bought it isn't even funny!  Try your hand at canning and try this recipe.  You will be so proud of your accomplishment.  (My mom says to go to a local farm and ask them to save you a box of green tomatoes and they will hold one aside for you, then you can just go there and pick them up).  So worth the work, and the pleasure of the relish is worth every minute!

I don't use tumeric much and I was worried that hubby wouldn't like the recipe. I was also a little frustrated with the instructions as written. The meatball ingredients are listed first but the instructions launch into the vegetable instructions saying to add all the other ingredients. A newbie cook could easily get confused! Also in #4 it says to cook on low presumably in the oven. I'm not familiar with low in the oven so I just cooked at 350F which is a standard baking temp. Also as I'm now seeing your picture, I see you sliced the carrots, the instructions say diced carrots, peeled and sliced. So I diced the carrots. No harm done... they still tasted fine. <br/>I live in the US where we don't default to metric but luckily I have a scale which converts. I used the full amount of carrots but only had about 500g of green beans. I told DH that it was supposed to have more but he said he liked the porportions that I made.<br/>With the above complaints I was tempted to give it 3 stars but was surprised and pleased with the actual recipe. It was very easy to throw together and felt very healthy because of all the vegetables. In the past, DH has not been a big meatball fan but he said he liked them because they didn't dry out. I didn't have anything to serve it with except white rice... I think that flatbread would be the ideal choice. I still may try the original recipe one time to see which I want to make on an ongoing basis. Thanks for posting!

It baked for 15 minutes longer than it was supposed to, which must be because of my oven, but that led to great texture, moisture ratio and golden crust on the bottom. I also used frozen blueberries. I&#039;ll definitely be going back to this recipe! It received rave reviews from a skilled baker who is usually, while not a harsh critic, certainly not a flatterer.

I modified the recipe as others had suggested: used slightly less sugar (I used 3/8 cup sugar) with more milk (2 TBSP more) and increased flour by 1/8 cup to compensate for the additional sugar, and only used 1/8 cup of sugar for the top (which was plenty) but followed everything else the same. The batter will be substantially thicker than cake batter and pancake mix but not as thick as flour dough, somewhere in-between. It's thin enough if you can easily stir it with a fork. I didn't add cinnamon or nutmeg as many suggested and was very pleasantly surprised by the yummy taste of the underlying cake - the blueberry taste came thru on the backdrop of this simple vanilla cake base. Was glad I sprinkled the vanilla extract over the top (instead of incorporating it into the batter) because it gave the very top an extra-flavor here-and-there that was surprisingly yummy yet subtle. My elementary-aged son and daughter both gobbled this up. Highly recommend this as an after dinner dessert, for afternoon tea, or breakfast. Would be wonderful for guests or a potluck too, because it presents itself well and tastes yummy!!! Blueberries look so lovely on top of the white cake. (I baked it in an 8&quot; square pan at 350F with an additional 10 minutes from original recipe.)"},{"name":"golden onion and dill frittata","steps":"in 8-inch nonstick skillet , heat oil over medium heat', 'cook onion , stirring occasionally , until softened and golden , about 7 minutes', 'in a bowl , whisk together eggs , milk , dill , mustard , salt and pepper', 'sprinkle croutons over onions', 'pour egg mixture over croutons , stirring gently to combine', 'cover and cook over medium-low heat until set , about 15 minutes', 'flip frittata onto serving plate', 'to serve cut into wedges'","description":"similar to a quiche without the crust, tasty served with a broccoli salad! i recently made this for brunch, it was excellent served with some smoked salmon. recipe from canadian living magazine.","ingredients":"vegetable oil', 'onion', 'crouton', 'eggs', 'milk', 'fresh dill', 'dijon mustard', 'salt', 'pepper'","review":"I love this recipe did half peaches chopped and half blueberries last time and the peaches really gave it that extra wow factor going to try doubling the recipe today hope I don't screw it up lol"},{"name":"golden onion bake","steps":"preheat oven to 350-degrees', 'butter casserole dish', 'melt butter in large skillet and add onions', 'cook until tender and translucent', 'stir often', 'transfer onions to prepared dish', 'combine milk , soup , salt and pepper in a bowl', 'pour over onions', 'sprinkle cut cheese over top', 'brown bread slices in skillet', 'add butter as needed', 'placed on top of casserole with browned side up', 'bake until bread browns even more', 'about 30 minutes', 'serve hot'","description":"onion lovers unite!!! this is a very good side dish for bbq. i found this recipe in a magazine over ten years ago, i think while waiting at the vet's. vidalias are best, but i just use spanish, red's, or any combination thereof.","ingredients":"butter', 'onions', 'cream of chicken soup', 'milk', 'salt', 'white pepper', 'gruyere cheese', 'french bread'","review":"I used half the sugar for sprinkling over the berries (full amount for the dry ingredients mix) and added 1/2 tsp.
