I only had enough ingreds for a half batch, and I also didn't think anyone but me would be eating these, and maybe I will be the only one eating 'em. I made these for breakfast. Honestly they turned out more like a bar cookie than a granola bar, but oh my are they wonderful. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and left out the white sugar. I used the miniumum amount of margarine and I used Smart Balance with Flaxseed Oil Spread, and Eggbeaters (which was easy to halve lol - 1/8 cup instead of 1/4 cup). I used an 8in. square baking pan sprayed with Pam. I cooled this for about 30mins. Btw, this smells wonderful while baking. I baked for 20 mins which was perfect.

Very similar to what I make only I add the ginger garlic to the marinade and marinate for 2 hours. Also I saute 1/2 cup of onion paste in a little oil till golden brown and add  1/2 cup of tomato puree(instead of using tomato paste) to this and cook for 10-15 mins and keep aside. I then add this to the sliced onions when they are being sauteed. I use 2 tsp of my garam masala which contains cumin and coriander. The rest of the method is the same. I just felt I could give you my version of Chicken Jalfrezi. We enjoy this dish a lot too. I serve it normally with Indian bread.

I added a chopped cucumber to the salad, and I used light ranch dressing to cut out some of the fat.  It makes A LOT of dressing - way more than I would use on a salad.  I also did not like the look of any of the bagged salads, so I used 2 heads of torn up romaine.  It was probably a little too much lettuce, but as I was bringing it to a large gathering, I wanted it to go further.  I really resisted adding bacon or bacon bits to this salad.  I thought it would be a good addition, but I wanted to see how the original recipe was.  The original is great, but I think it would be a good addition to have the bacon - probably just 3 or 4 slices cooked and crumbled.

Maybe next time I'll try 1/2 tablespoon and see if that kicks up the cinnamon flavoring.  Other than that, I think I would make this again if I can figure out the cinnamon and crumbly pastry issues.

I served this with your Recipe #7182 for a delectable and very German Sunday lunch. I don't have a Spaetzle grater, although I used to have one in Germany, I think it got lost in the move! However, I am quite good at the old slotted spoon method, which is how I made these today. I overcooked them a LITTLE bit, my fault and not yours, so they don't look as defined as yours do, but they were tasty all the same. I used my own home dried sage, as I lost my sage this winter:-( so I could not garnish it with fresh sage leaves this time. The nutmeg is JUST the right amount and made it very authentic in flavour. We are trying to keep our saturated fats down, so I also cut way back on the butter, used just enough to carry the herbs and give the spaetzle some gloss.

I made this last night for just DH and I so I cut the recipe down, didn&#039;t have green peppers so I used a poblano and a yellow pepper, more onion and used fresh garlic with the onions and peppers.  I sauteed the vegies a little then added the celery soup (might use mushroom next time DH suggested) and a little less sour cream and chicken broth for the water and bouillon cubes.  I did season and brown the chops and everything was just delicious.  Thank you for posting and this is going into my Favorites of 2013.  Served with red garlic mashed potatoes and recipe#283350#283350 and we had a great dinner.

I didn't feel like making sugar cookies from scratch this year so I was going to buy sugar cookie mix. When I went to the commisary there was not one box, tube, or package of sugar cookie mix or dough anywhere. Somehow I remembered saving this recipe to my cook book last year so I bought the pound cake mix.  It was so easy to mix up, even my daughter helped.  We rolled out half the dough and used cookie cutters and made round drop cookies with the other half.  The dough was very easy to work with as long as we kept our rolling pin and surface floured. We rolled the dough directly onto parchment paper and used the cookie cutters directly on it so we would have to transfer the cookies onto the cookie sheet and lose their shape. The baked up nicely in 9 minutes exactly and held their shape well. The surface was not as smooth as a homemade cookie, but it didn't matter at all since we covered it with icing anyway. My husband tried one of the round cookies and exclaimed, Wow! what happened to hard brittle sugar cookies?! These are great!.  The cut outs were a bit more crispy but still very tasty.  These were the best sugar cookies we have tasted, no need to make them from scratch any more thanks to your recipe.

I cheated and boiled potatoes for lack of time. I boiled them in chicken broth but saved the broth after boiling and rinsing the potatoes. To this starchy broth I added more to get the needed 4 cups. This allowed me to skip the corn starch per the recipe. I also added four cheese instant mashed potatoes per a review to add the cheese flavor.
