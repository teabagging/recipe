Of course it can! And, basic, minimal ingredients often allow the taste and texture of the food, to shine through.  I followed this recipe closely, but marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and lightly sprinkled salt, for a few hours, before baking it (just because I almost always prefer marinating chicken, to prevent over-drying, via cooking the chicken).  I also added a few additional spices -rosemary (love rosemary on chicken) and paprika. Finally, after baking the chicken legs for 25 mins on each side, I placed the chicken legs, under the broiler, for a few minutes, to crisp up the chicken. This was so yummy!!!

I made this in a shortbread crust, and if I make this again in a different crust, I might like it a bit better next time. That might just be because I'm more partial to graham cracker crusts.

Tso&#039;s chicken our restaurant makes. They deep fry it.  It is good to use apple cider or rice wine vinegar if it is too sour.  For those who don&#039;t like Splenda ( I love it) try coconut sugar (supposed to be low glycemic), agave syrup or Nectresse (sweeter than Splenda and has a fruity taste).  We use them all because we are diabetic.  Fresh ginger and garlic offer a lot more flavor than dry.   We also use Better Than Bouillon chicken flavor which has no MSG and lots of flavor.  If you have a wheat allergy tamari sauce is a great substitute for soy sauce.  Tamari is made soley from soy beans whereas regular soy sauces are made with wheat and soy. Lastly, if you want to use white rice which is very nearly the same in nutritional value, we dry roast it first  to opaqueness (?) to convert the starch which seems to lower the carb count allowing us to eat it.

Probably has a million calories and you can taste every single one of them. Divine. I didn't have butter flavour extract so I left it out, and when I went to get my skor bits they were all fused together from the humidity, so I ended up melting them with the ingredients in step 1. This is probably a good thing since DH tend not to like hard bits in ice cream. In the past, I have had a lot of problems with my ice cream maker getting things thick, so I thickened the mixture in step 3 with several tablespoons cornstarch and whipped the cream before adding in step 5. I think I only needed to do this to compensate for having a cheap ice cream maker and it worked great.

Otherwise it was a wonderful soup (tho was hard to eat in large quantities. It is best as a small appetizer soup)&lt;br/&gt;--As for side notes. I made this soup from the scrapings of my pumpkin when i hollowed it for carving. My pumpkin was a pale orange, and very watery. When I stuck the pieces in the oven to bake, a lot of the liquid poured out into the baking sheet. I started with trying to strain all the excess liquid as there was a lot, but between straining, it had gotten on my hands so I decided to lick off some of the excess. It was surprisingly good. I figured it would be a great addition to the Vegetable Broth that I used as the base. I actually even steamed my carrots with it ^-^ which was interesting lol. Might not do that again next time as it took away from the carrot taste.&lt;br/&gt;Because I was using scrapings from my pumpkin, I couldnt saute it with the apple or carrots. So I steamed my carrots, sauteed the apple in cinnamon and butter since i did not have sage. Then pureed the three together. I didnt add the onion because my vegetable broth that I had made had a very strong onion taste and smell to it already. &lt;br/&gt;For a little bit of chunk to it, I chopped up some almonds and toasted them with my pumpkin seeds which i then sprinkled ontop of the soup.

I halved this recipe and prepared this mix. I used 4 cups of Nido milk powder, 2 1/4 cups of Coffeemate, 2 cups and a little over 1/4 cup of Nesquik chocolate milk powder and a little less than 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. This made a total of 9 cups of Hot Chocolate Mix for me. Initially I used 1/3 cup of this mix for a little less than a cup of boiling water. On stirring it and sipping it, I found it to be not as sweet as I would normally have liked it to be. I added 3 tbsps. more of the mix, stirred and then had it. It was fine then. Topped with marshmallows, this will surely become more sweeter. Since I don't have those on hand, I used more of the mix. About 1-2 marshmallows should be fine for a cup of this mix, IMO. Thanks for the recipe!\\nPlease note: Just to help anyone who wishes to try this mix in future, here is something:\\n454gms. of Coffeemate = 4 3/4 cups\\n454 gms. of Nesquik = 4 cups and a little over 1/2 cup\\n8 quarts of Nido milk powder = 8 cups\\nPowdered sugar, ofcourse, is given clearly as 2/3 cup, so that should not be a problem for anyone."},{"name":"green eggs  noodles  and ham","steps":"saute onions in butter', 'add spices , stir in wine to deglaze pan', 'stir in horseradish , if using ,', 'and stir in the pan with the rest of the ingredients', 'add the parmesan , gently simmer while you cook the noodles', 'cook and drain the noodles', 'toss the noodles with the sauce , taste for seasonings , adjust if needed', 'enjoy !'","description":"this kid pleasing meal is based on a family favorite and of course, inspired by story time with dr seuss.  i adapted the recipe by using light cream instead of the usual sour cream and it turned out even better!  creamy, delicious goodness and a quick to make solution for busy family schedules!","ingredients":"spinach noodles', 'butter', 'ham', 'horseradish cream', 'sour cream', 'salt and black pepper', 'parmesan cheese'","review":"This is a superb recipe and I think it is nicely sweet, even with the addition of the marshmallows.

The recipes for sage and hot sausage in this recipe are almost the same as ours. The difference is that we never used MSG. MSG is a migraine trigger, and a pretty powerful one. This is a very good recipe, and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if you had mentioned somewhere, for the sake of those who are unaware, that MSG should be omitted from the recipe if anyone in the family is prone to migraines. I know from experience that a severe migraine can be debilitating and can last sometimes for two or three days, possibly longer. The pork, beef, or turkey that my family used for sausage was usually smoked, which gave the sausage a subtle hickory smoke flavor. When my grandmother made sausage, she added a very small amount of sugar or maple syrup to enhance the flavor of the spices. \\nOther than the MSG, I like the recipe very much.

Just added everything in there, then baked it on the bottom rack at 350 for about an hour.  Next time I will try to parbake, just to see if there's a difference, but it still turned out pretty decent.

It reminded me of Thai cooking (even without the modifications). Thai uses a lot of peanut, and this definitely had that nutty taste, and very creamy.
