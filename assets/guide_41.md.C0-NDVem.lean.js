I made two versions of this recipe. One exactly as written (but I had to use can crab meat, its hard to find fresh ones in my area). I also tweaked the recipe and substituted the cream to coconut cream to make it OK for me to eat and used prawns/shrimp. I also omitted the boiled egg. This dressing could be used not only as crab salad but a seafood salad. Its so good!

I didn't fry my tortillas, but didn't have any problems with cracking as they were pretty soft and fresh.  I only had 6 burrito size flour tortillas on hand, so I used those and they fit in my 13x9 perfectly.

My top round steak weighed 1.88 pounds and was done and easy to shred in 6.5 hours. For my crockpot, the recipes recommended cooking time would have been far too long and the meat would have been dry I'm afraid. It's important to be familiar with your slow cooker, because they all seem to be different when it comes to heat levels, and I did cook mine on low the entire time. I will definately be adding this yummy meal to our rotation. From what I can tell, this is perfect as written; I could see no reason for altering ingredients unless you want more heat or spice.

ardmore, pa. betty and her husband are from hunan and have returned to visit, so the recipe is authentic to the region, both by family history, by recent comparison, and by my own review of chinese regional cookbooks.\\n\\noriginally a sichuan regional specialty, hot and sour soup has become a staple at every chinese restaurant, no matter what regional style they claim as a specialty. clearly, as with many soups, individual variations are easy and can vary the flavor considerably.\\n\\none of the ways i judge any chinese restaurant the first time i eat there is by the quality of their hot and sour soup ... this one is superb!\\n\\nto make a kosher meat version, replace the pork with (kosher) chicken or turkey and replace the broth with a kosher broth (watch the salt if you use a commercial broth). to make a vegetarian version, use a vegetable broth and add a variety of sliced fresh mushrooms (e.g., shiitake, oyster). to make it vegan, use the above substitutions for vegetarian and skip the eggs.\\n\\nrecipe makes about 48 oz of soup, so you can serve 4 @ 12 oz or 6 @ 8 oz.\\n\\noctober 2008 -- addendum. thanks to all the fellow recipezaar foodies who have tried this recipe ... there have been two major issues raised: the amount of vinegar and the spiciness. re the vinegar, i went back and asked betty foo about the white distilled vs rice vinegar. so far as she knows, both are the same acidity (5%, marked on the bottle) and while the taste is different (the rice vinegar provides a more subtle flavor), they should be equivalent. she noted that rice vinegar comes in a seasoned and unseasoned version (for marukan, look at the label and the cap color to see the difference), but this shouldn't affect the acidity the vinegar provides. i'll make versions with both vinegars and update this note with some recommendations if i taste a significant difference.\\n\\nre the spiciness, as noted, this soup comes from sichuan, known for its love of spiciness. it may be more than you are used to, so by all means, feel free to adjust the pepper components (and other components) to your taste. \\n\\nalso, re substituting fresh mushrooms for the dried, you should know that the dried mushrooms tend to give a more intense and woodsy flavor than fresh ... the opposite of the situation with fresh herbs vs dried. don't be surprised if you prefer the recipe done with dried mushrooms!\\n\\nre the ginger, it should be added at step 11, with other spices. it adds to the hot flavor by infusing the broth and the pieces add to the texture. you could, if you wanted to increase the hot of the pepper and the crunch of the veggies, divide the ginger and add some at the end as a garnish. i prefer not to, simply because i prefer the hot and sour components to be more of a blended flavor ...","ingredients":"dried lily buds', 'dried mushroom', 'firm tofu', 'pork', 'eggs', 'bamboo shoot', 'cornstarch', 'water', 'distilled white vinegar',

The smell was lovely.. the cinnamon stitcks and ginger especially fragerant as this simmered. I must be honest however and say that I found that the taste didn't match up nearly well enough to the smell. Looking at the other reviews it must be entirely personal, and maybe I am so used to the taste of my pure Rooibos that this just doesn't taste right to me? Please see my rating system: 2 stars for a recipe that I was very pleased to try but which didn't suit my taste in the end. Other reviewers  obviously enjoy it very much so PLEASE don't let my review put anyone off in any way. Give it a go for yourself.

Everybody seemed to like the fluffy chocolately flavor of it.  For construction, though, I rate it about three stars, because the dough turned out incredibly sticky and hard to handle.  I ended up having to spoon the dough into individual foil cups so it would have some sort of uniform shape.  The other thing I found odd is that unlike most scones, this calls for room temperature butter.  All the scone recipes I've tried have called for extremely cold butter so that it melts in the oven and not in the bowl.  And even though it calls to be refrigerated, I still didn't get the scone flavor I was craving.  Next time I may modify it a smidge to fit my flavor, but overall, it definitely is tasty.

Bottom line, we all really liked it!  However, the recipe is off in a few areas. First, the times listed were not accurate for me at all. The mushrooms didn't give off their liquid or brandy evaporate in times provided. I ended up just playing it by ear.  I would suggest slicing the mushrooms so they cook better. The recipe needs much more salt and pepper than the amounts given. I probably doubled both. I am still wondering if the dip is supposed to be served hot (right out of the food processor), chilled or at room temp.  I served it slightly warmed with homemade garlic parmesan crostini, which was delicious. I wasn't quite sure what garlic rounds were. I will make this again with my modifications.

I followed that with a light layer of shredded cheese, then the cornbread part, followed by a bit more cheese. I changed the cornbread part just a bit: using whole wheat flour and 3 egg whites. I took the milk option but also added a bit of powdered milk to the dry ingredients to enrich it. I baked it for about 35 minutes, which I think was just about right (I had thinner cornbread stuff, but more moisture, than would be in the regular recipe). To my immense surprise and delight, the whole thing worked really well. The little bit of cheese on top made a tasty, slightly baked-cheese-flavored crust.

Wow was I right with that decision.  This cornbread is light, tasteful and extremely moreish.  I had to make a couple of wee changes.  For a start my daughter (27 yrs old) had used up the last of the cheese and not told me.  So I sub&#039;ed with a small amount of freshly grated Parmesan Cheese which helped keep down the calories too.  I used fat reduced milk in place for the cream / milk combo.  Not sure how long I cooked it for as I forget to put on the timer and had to keep checking it.  I suspect it took longer than 35 minutes to cook.

I made these for the younger neices and nephews today.   I used the miniature candy bars which are smaller so I used just one gummy bear per sled.  They were just adorable.

I used square mint thins in place of the chocolate bar. I added some decorating icing recipe # 143816 on the top of the sleigh to resemble snow. I placed a big gummy santa at the front and different types of small candy on the back to resemble gifts. I made these for my sons Christmas party at school and they were a big hit. They all looked so cute on the tray together. This was easy to prepare, just give yourself enough time for the chocolate to set when adding the candy canes. I found it easier to attach the candy canes on the bottom rather than the sides and let them harden upside down.I let mine set up in the fridge.
