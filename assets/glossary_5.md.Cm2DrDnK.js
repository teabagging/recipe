It was very easy, and had a great flavor.  I surely will be making this again.  Some notes:  The caraway, which is optional, is what really made the dish delicious and a bit different.  I used chicken leg quarters, which I cut, removing whatever fat I could.  For ease, I used my food processor to chop the garlic and parsley, then added the Italian dressing, 1 t. salt and some pepper.  Marinated in a freezer bag overnight.  I cut the carrots into chunks and used lots more - they were the first to go, so I do recommend lots if your family eats them.   I added 3 small onions to my clay pot, and next time, I think I'll also add some cut up cabbage.  Also, the chicken will make its own juice in the pot.  After cooking, I put the chicken in a pan under the broiler for a couple of minutes to further brown/crisp it, removed the veggies to a serving dish, and defatted the chicken liquid to serve alongside.  Yum!  Thanks again, Angela, for a winning recipe.

They turned out wonderful.  The buns were very soft and flavorful.  Please see the picture of my kolaches in the Photo section.  I made the dough in a stand mixer instead of a bread machine.  The directions for my variation are below.  Note that the recipe makes 8 very large buns or 12 regular sized buns.<br/><br/>Dry 8 jumbo hot dogs or 12 regular size hot dogs with a paper towel. I used turkey dogs to cut the fat.  Warm the water to 105 to 110 degrees F.  Add 1/4 cup of the warm water, 2 teaspoons of the sugar, and the yeast into the work bowl of the mixer.  Allow to sit a few minutes to proof.  Add the rest of the ingredients as in the original recipe and knead with a dough hook for 7 to 8 minutes.  I added 1/4 cup additional flour because the dough was too sticky.  Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise for about 45 minutes.  Cut the dough into 8 pieces if using jumbo dogs or 12 pieces if using regular size dogs, and flatten each piece into a rectange about the length of the hot dogs.  Roll the dough around the hot dog and pinch the seam well to close.  You can use the hot dog like a rolling pin :o).  Place kolache on a baking sheet seam side down.  Continue to make 8 or 12 kolaches.  Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise about 30 minutes.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes at 400 degrees F.

Anyway, it all came together very nicely, with a combination of baking & broiling! Very tasty; very, very nice! Many thanks! I might be a day late in adding something that should have been included before, but it was brought to my attention that I didn't include my baking process ~ Well, I followed the recipe to the point of grilling, then baked the breasts for 35 minutes at 375 degrees F, before putting them under the broiler JUST LONG ENOUGH to brown them a little.

I was skeptical at first, but i recently had a great steak marinaide with grape jelly so i gave it a shot. The ONLY cherry preserves i could find was a 9.5 oz jar of bing cherry spreadable fruit - which made everything sorta a deep red/purple color. I didnt print out the recipe so i didnt even notice you were suppose to heat up the mixture first - didnt seem to hurt it any tho. I made some changes - i didnt have dijon mustard so i used 1 tbsp of spicy brown mustard plus 1 tbsp honey, and used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce and regular soy sauce. I threw half in with the chicken to sit overnight in a plastic bag, turned it twice and the rest in a bowl to brush while cooking. When I cooked it i sorta followed Sydney Mikes advice, and threw it in a dish at 375 for 17 minutes and brushed with the sauce, then drained the dish, flipped and repeted. While that was cooking i heated up what i had saved so the preserves would melt (like i was suppose to in the first place lol), then transfered to a broil pan and gave each side a generous brush and 3 minutes under the broiler. Next time i will grab another jar of preserves, because the sauce is really good and i would have loved some more slathered on after cooking, but i dont like to use the extra from marinadeing for anything. This isnt as sweet as i was anticipateing, which is great, everyone loved it and i will make again."},{"name":"aloha joes","steps":"heat a large skillet over medium-high heat', 'crumble meat into pan and cook until no longer pink', 'reduce heat to medium', 'add garlic and onion , cook until onion is soft', 'drain and discard excess fat', 'sprinkle meat mixture with salt and pepper', 'add tomato sauce , worchestershire sauce and chili powder', 'simmer , uncovered , 15 minutes', 'stir in pineapple', 'remove from heat', 'spoon onto buns'","description":"found this interesting take on sloppy joes in my kenny roger's cookbook.","ingredients":"ground round', 'garlic cloves', 'onion', 'salt', 'pepper', 'tomato sauce', 'worcestershire sauce', 'chili powder', 'pineapple tidbits', 'hamburger buns'","review":"This is a great recipe - especially good on a hot summer's evening as we had last night.

I'm sure real will make it even better. A keeper for sure! \\nUPDATE: This time I made it with the chocolate chips & while they didn't take away from the bread, I'm not sure they really added to it either.

And I added some sage and thyme to the parsley, also in step 2. I initially decided on using only two eggs, and adding another if it seemed necessary. After kneading as instructed, two eggs seemed ideal for a good consistency. The triangular shape was a novel idea, and really neat when using the Koutlets as sandwich fillings - with salad greens - over the next few days: they fitted the bread perfectly! To reduce the fat content, I cooked my Koutlets at a medium heat in the oven on trays loosely covered in foil. They were moist and favoursome: the potatoes were a really nice touch.

I agree with twissis, these are not an everyday side dish, but they are definitely worth the occasional splurge! I had found some nice rock lobster tails at Costco, so I grilled those up to serve with these potatoes. I used some tiny yukon gold potatoes, so I quartered them lengthwise to get tiny wedges. I didn't have a problem with the tops getting too dark, but maybe it's because my potatoes were so tiny that they started off covered in the cream mixture. Edited to add: I almost forgot, I used fresh parsley in place of the flakes because I had so much on hand. Thanks for posting!

It took me about 3 hours to make these.  I'm still not sure I'd make them again because of how much work they are to make.  I took them to a pot luck, and they were all eaten.  Everyone commented that they looked and tasted like they took a long time to prepare.  Well, they did.  Also, most people only ate half the cookie and shared the other half with someone else.  They're rich, pretty and unusual but not the kind of dessert you want to keep popping into your mouth. Oh, and mine did not look like peaches, but they still looked good.  Here are a few tips if you attempt this recipe: 1) Start scooping out the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven, and work very fast.  When the cookies cooled, they became crumbliy and would break apart. 2) After scooping out the insides, lay the cookies upside down with the hole facing up in a line.  That way they'll be ready for the assembly line filling.  3) I put the preserves (I used about 1 cup of preserves) into a ziplock bag and snip off the end.  Then squirt the preserves into each hole.  4)I used peach schnapps instead of the brandy, and I used a bit over 1/2 cup.  5) Use small amounts of sugar for the rolling because it gets moist and sticky really quickly, so I kept having to toss it out and refill the bowl."},{"name":"amish baked fried chicken","steps":"mix the beaten egg and milk together', 'dip chicken parts in liquid', 'stir together the salt , pepper and cracker crumbs', 'dip chicken in dry mixture , using a spoon to cover well', 'melt butter in a heavy cast iron skillet', 'brown chicken well on both sides', 'remove from stove top and place into the oven , cover with foil and bake at 325 degrees for 30 minutes', 'uncover and continue baking for an aditional 30 minutes'","description":"when i visited amish country in penn. i fell in love with the fried chicken they made. here is one of their recipes. very tasty!","ingredients":"chicken', 'egg', 'milk', 'salt', 'pepper', 'cracker crumb', 'butter'","review":"these are worth the effort!  i made these for my son's class so i brushed them with peach juice with a bit of food colouring instead of the brandy.  i also filled them with custard instead of preserves.  i made the cookies and filled them with custard and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  the next morning i brushed them and rolled them.  they tasted the best the next day.  they looked amazing and the kids were so excited to eat them!  thanks for a great traditional recipe!"},{"name":"amish baked noodles with ham","steps":"saute the onion and celery in the 3 tablespoons of butter', 'add the flour and mustard and heat for a couple of minutes until the flour is cooked', 'gradually add the milk , stirring constantly , and continue heating until thickened', 'stir in the ham and peas and then toss in the noodles', 'season to taste with salt and pepper', 'pour into a greased casserole dish', 'sprinkle the top with bread crumbs and dot with butter', 'bake at 350f for about 45 minutes'","description":"insanely delicious comfort food!","ingredients":"onion', 'celery', 'butter', 'flour', 'mustard', 'milk', 'cooked ham', 'frozen green pea', 'egg noodles', 'salt and pepper', 'breadcrumbs'","review":"I too have this recipe but I bruch mine with eggs whites and roll the cookies in a package of peach and organe jello.
