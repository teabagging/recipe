He also could find only organic red potatoes at the store.  There was almost no water that drained off them.  I have made these for over 30 years and this was the best batch I have ever had.  We called it Krub in my family too.  We make them about tennis ball size and then slightly flatten them.  They cook faster that way.  My mom made them the size of softballs and they took much longer to cook. She also used an old hand cranked grinder that we ran the potatoes and onion through, but I have found that grating works just as well.  In fact my grandmother used her food processor.  Good comfort food.  I made a small batch of Krub today from russet potatoes, expecting them to release a lot of water.  It turns out the potatoes did not have water collected at the bottom of the pan after I grated them.  I wait a bit and they stayed dry.  So I added the flour a little at a time and became worried I would have to add water to the flour and ground potatoes, because the dough was dry and crumbling.  I let it sit for 5 minutes and came back and started to knead the dough and long story short,  I ended up having to add even more flour.  So making these depends a lot on your potatoes.  Usually I have to drain the excess water off.'"},{"name":"Comfort Soup a la Montreal","rate":"4.521739006","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/720x405/1971658.jpg","ingredients":"large russet potatoes links hot Italian sausage large onion kale ribs removed chopped quarts chicken stock hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)","cooking":" Prep 20 m Cook 30 m Ready In 50 m Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water.

I kept measurements for the salsa the same, but added two avocados (small) to the blender to make a tomatillo-avocado salsa.

I used a 10 oz. bag of shredded cole slaw mix and combined it with the head of green leaf lettuce.  I added the red bell pepper, the fire-roasted niblets from the three ears of corn on the cob and the black beans to the lettuce/cabbage mixture, as well as about 1 cup of roasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds).  I tossed everything together.  When it was time to eat, I added the salsa to the lettuce mixture and tossed it; then topped the lettuce mixture with grilled chicken, and sprinkled with cotija cheese.

I too am from Springfield, MO, and have a recipe that is very close to this. However, mine calls for sugar in the sauce, and I really believe it gives it something that this recipe is lacking. Also, my method for battering is different. I coat the pieces in flour first (let sit in the flour to soak up the moisture on the chicken) then soak in a mixture of 4 eggs to 1 1/2 cups milk, also for a few minutes. Then redip in flour and deep fry. This makes the most incredible coating on the pieces, that really holds onto the sauce. By the way, I also use that method to make to-die-for chicken strips, adding salt and pepper to the final flour.'"},{"name":"Chelsea's Bacon Roast Chicken","rate":"4.538461685","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/557765.jpg","ingredients":"dried thyme dried oregano brown sugar ground cumin salt ground paprika ground black pepper garlic unsalted butter chicken garlic of thick-cut bacon","cooking":" Prep 30 m Cook 1 h Ready In 1 h 40 m Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Mix the thyme, oregano, brown sugar, cumin, salt, paprika, and black pepper in a bowl. Remove half the spice mixture to another bowl; stir the minced garlic and softened butter into the mix in one of the bowls. Loosen the skin of the chicken over the breast, back, and thighs. Rub the spice mixture containing garlic and butter thickly underneath the loosened skin. Rub the dry spice mixture generously over the outside of the chicken and sprinkle some in the cavity. Place the crushed garlic cloves into the cavity. Place the chicken on a roasting rack set in a roasting pan; arrange the bacon strips over the chicken in a basket-weave pattern. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and cook another 15 minutes. Reduce oven heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and roast until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. If the bacon starts to look too brown during roasting, cover the chicken with a sheet of aluminum foil. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C) when the meat is done. Remove the chicken from the oven and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing","reviews":"I was very disappointed with this meal :( The bacon came out brown and desiccated around the edges and pink in the middle.  Also, the skin on the chicken was soggy...not crisp the way I like it.'"},{"name":"Nichole's Chicken Cauliflower Soup","rate":"4.538461685","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/940274.jpg","ingredients":"medium red potatoes olive oil celery carrots onion garlic cloves salt ground black pepper chicken broth skim milk head cauliflower cut into small florets cooked chicken breasts grated reduced fat Parmesan cheese","cooking":" Prep 20 m Cook 1 h 10 m Ready In 1 h 30 m Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Threw in one teaspoon each of cumin and paprika in addition to a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give an extra kick of heat. I also sprinkled some salt to taste but tried to keep that to a minimum. All the flavors come together beautifully and I would highly recommend these additions to make this recipe more dynamic/complex! Also thought about adding some lime juice and cilantro but decided against it...maybe those would work well too. To serve the chili, I topped off the bowls with some thick shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and plenty of green onions for garnish...just the way I like it and oh so good!!!'"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:q},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(t=>{const a=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return t.name.toLowerCase().includes(a)||t.steps.toLowerCase().includes(a)||t.description.toLowerCase().includes(a)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},G={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],_={key:0},N={key:1};function V(t,a,o,m,r,s){const h=f("PoemCard");return i(),n("section",null,[a[3]||(a[3]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 recipe 🥳")])],-1)),e("div",G,[a[2]||(a[2]=e("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(e("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":a[0]||(a[0]=l=>r.searchQuery=l),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,r.searchQuery]])]),e("div",E,[(i(!0),n(u,null,p(s.filteredPoems,(l,g)=>(i(),v(h,{key:g,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[1]||(a[1]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(i(),n("span",N,"Loading...")):(i(),n("span",_,"See more"))],8,O)):I("",!0)])}const U=c(H,[["render",V],["__scopeId","data-v-fc25de53"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/32.md","filePath":"drive/32.md"}'),Y={name:"drive/32.md"},Q=Object.assign(Y,{setup(t){return(a,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[C(U)]))}});export{K as __pageData,Q as default};
