Also, I turned the dough out onto a well floured sheet of parchment, but rather than covering with another piece of parchment, I sprinkled a little GF flour on the dough and my hand and pressed the dough out, using my other hand to maintain a square edge. As I don't care for a lot of icing I made 1/4 of the recipe and just drizzled over the rolls while hot. Also, since there WAS a lot of filling in these, I greased my pan then put a sqare of parchment in the bottom and greased it again.

They are a bloody lot of work, however, especially if you're anal about getting the crackers thin enough (like I was), so set aside anywhere from 1-2 hours.  Definitely work with small pieces of dough (I broke mine into about 10 small pieces).  I found it necessary to re-moisten the reserved dough every so often with about a tablespoon of water per tenth, as it became dry and tough to work with-- and this was during a humid November north Texas evening!  But I think this problem was caused by the bran-for-germ substitution.  However, I was a virgin cracker baker before this, so those less green than I may not have the aforementioned problems.  I'm pleased with the number of crackers this made: it filled an 8-cup or 1.9 liter plastic container!  We'll have crackers-and-cheese brown bag lunches for my son for 2 weeks!

I did add about 1/4 tsp. salt because I'm not concerned about the salt content and wanted the flavor. I would add a bit more next time. To make it easier, rather than rolling and cutting individual crackers and having to transfer them to the baking pans, I sprayed large cookie sheets without sides with Pam, and rolled the dough right on the pans all the way to the edges. Scored them with a pizza cutter, and broke apart after baking. Very easy and only took about 15 minutes. I did need to add about 2 T. more water to the dough to get it to hold together, maybe because I substituted oat bran for the wheat germ. I covered the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes before rolling out.

I had boneless skinless chicken thighs, a partial bag of frozen mixed vegies that I needed to use up and added to the called-for vegies, and lots of coarse black pepper.

I agree with Tom too- I did find this needed a bit of liquid- I added about a Tbs water to get the spices to coat everything.  I used a red onion (the yellow onions we have right now are the size of your head, so we didn't feel like cutting into one) and substituted the fresh chili with about 1/2 tsp Zhoug (#57689).

Adding a tablespoon of coconut oil helps me get my daily quota in, and stops the porridge from sticking to the saucepan so easily.

Can be as elegant or as informal as you like.\\n\\nI'm not a coconut fan and would leave it out next time, but my kids both loved it with coconut and would definitely vote to keep it. They both had seconds -- that's a real vote!! I made the recipe exactly as written, using a commercially prepared mild curry powder. Clearly, once you've made it, you can adjust the spices to your own taste and tolerance. As made, a little heat was noticeable, but no one had any discomfort over the spiciness of the dish.\\n\\nThe author clearly points out that the chef needs to monitor the saltiness of the eggplant in the production. If you use the small oriental eggplant (eg, Japanese egglant or the Asian round eggplant), you may not need to use salt to draw out the water from the eggplant. \\n\\nDefinitely a keeper recipe. Can be made on a weeknight after work. Thanks, Vegan4TheWin, for sharing this with us!\\n\\nMade for PAC Fall 2008.

I liked the idea of serving in the eggplant shell, but it was too soft to hold up....that wasn't a big deal though.  I use all of these ingredients very often which is what drew me to trying this, however I missed that usual addition of garlic & ginger that you normally see in a curry.  The biggest thing for me was the amount of small bits to chew through in the finished product with so many mustard seeds, eggplant seeds and the dried coconut.  So I'd agree with Gandalf the White about maybe leaving the coconut out next time.

DH made this for dinner tonight and we enjoyed it over pasta. I'm not certain about this serving more than 2-3 people, I went back for seconds and DH had beaten me to it and there was none left. My standard sized blender was only about 1/5th full at most, the total ingedients not adding up to a huge amount... so next time we will definiately be doubling the recipe. I had homemade vegetable stock in the freezer but DH didn't find it so he used the water option instead... and he used a pinch of sugar and a decent amount of red pepper flakes. The result was a spicy, garlic-y tomato sauce with hints of onion in the mix... quite strong tasting but FULL of flavour. Please see my rating system: 5 excellent stars for pleasing DH who declared that we must definiately save this recipe as he enjoyed it very much. High praise indeed from the Pasta Fanatic. If you are not overly keen on onion. garlic or pepper flakes then this recipe might be too strong for your tastes, but if like us, you appreciate these in spades, then this IS a recipe that you will enjoy as much as we did.

So, I just used the olive oil and followed step 1 exactly.  Careful with your garlic so it doesn't burn (this will turn it bitter).  So, on concept this one would get 5 stars... but on writeup it is a bit confusing as the written directions don't have tarragon or thyme in it.  I omitted the cumin all together.

The main reason I chose this recipe was that I absolutely loved the Dole Whip I ate in Hawaii and wanted to recreate at home. Unfortunately, this recipe is not easy to follow. First, the size of the batch is not given. Also, the size of the ice cream maker is not given. In addition, the amount of milk to use is not specified, either. I know that there are recipes, usually for larger ice cream makers, that say, as this recipe does, add milk to the mark in the ice cream maker. In most cases, I would not attempt this kind of recipe if I had no idea how big the ice cream maker was. However, I thought I could perhaps scale this recipe for my own smaller canister type ice cream maker, if I kept the proportions of the ingredients that the amounts were given for. I then ran into trouble with the amount of sugar. I did look at other ice cream recipes on this site, but did not find any with the amounts of sugar and cream equal. I suppose it might be possible for a very big ice cream maker, using quite a lot of additional milk. But the amount of pineapple juice is not so very much at all. Certainly, for a very large amount of milk, you would need a correspondingly large amount of pineapple juice. For these reasons, I do not think that this recipe could be followed faithfully, regardless of the amount of milk, to produce good pineapple flavored soft ice cream, which is what Dole Whip is. Nonetheless, I still wanted to try it, so I scaled the amounts of pineapple juice, cream and vanilla by 75%. I used only 3/4 cup sugar, and no milk. This was about twice as much mixture as my ice cream maker could handle, so I made the ice cream in two batches. Somewhat to my surprise (and relief), the resulting ice cream tastes nice. It does not have as strong a pineapple flavor as Dole Whip, however. (I did use Dole 100% pineapple juice.) I think I would have to either use pureed canned pineapple or pineapple juice concentrate (if such a thing exists) for a stronger flavor. I am sorry this did not work out very well, but it was a learning experience.

Anyway, this recipe makes a great Pineapple Ice cream....smooth and flavorful.   I have a small ice cream maker, and it works great.

I have no clue how much sugar was SUPPOSED to be in it because you didnt specify, but I did not think I would need more than 2lbs for only 2 potatoes.

Crazy, I tell ya.  This was very good bread.  The aroma of it cooking was wonderful.  I think I used probably twice as much roasted red pepper and maybe an extra clove of garlic, but I still didn't have to make any adjustments to any of the other ingredients.  (I always watch the dough develop, though, just to make sure no more water or flour needs to be added.)  Even though this bread has cheese in it, it just screams to be eaten with cheese.  I think it would be good paired with pretty much any kind of cheese.  Pair it with a cheese and a glass of wine, and you could have yourself a meal.  (Or at least a really great snack!)  I also think cream cheese would be nice on this.  I let mine cook in the bread machine, because I like how crispy breads with cheese get when cooked in the machine; however, for a softer crust, you could probably use oil in place of butter, and cook this in the oven instead of in the bread machine, which is probably what I would try if I were going to use this for sandwiches.
