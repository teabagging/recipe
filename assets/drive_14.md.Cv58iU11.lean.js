I also changed the crumb topping to a rye bread option.  I cubed 6 pieces of rye and tossed in the same amount of butter which made a nice , toasty topping similar to the sandwich.  I, too, added caraway seeds like many other reviews suggest.  Adding a pinch of brown sugar is another option to tame the bite of sauerkraut.

It was good and my family really liked it. The only change I will make next time is using less liquid, just a bit, not much.  Maybe adding shredded mozzarella cheese to the chicken mixture will help.  I will make it again as my family really wants it....'"},{"name":"Mild Thai Beef with a Tangerine Sauce","rate":"4.166666508","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/250438.jpg","ingredients":"dry Chinese noodles hoisin sauce dry sherry tangerine zest ground ginger vegetable oil flank beef steak vegetable oil small butternut squash sliced fresh mushrooms large red onion cabbage thinly sliced tangerine sectioned and seeded","cooking":" Prep 20 m Cook 25 m Ready In 45 m Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
