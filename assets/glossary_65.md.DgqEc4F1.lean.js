I followed the recipe ALMOST to the letter, with only 2 little changes. The few days prior to Thanksgiving, hubby and I got into a potato skin&quot; eating marathon. Each day that I made the potato skins, I saved the &quot;guts&quot; of the potatoes in a tupper-ware bowl in the fridge. I say that I probably had made at least 12 pre-baked potatoes. So on Thanksgiving, I simply made the remainder of this recipe, skipping the boiling of raw potatoes. After everything was mixed, the potatoes seemed a bit thick (maybe because they were a little cold to start or that I had too many potatoes). I placed them in the oven as directed. About 10 minutes into baking, hubby asked if I would put some shredded cheddar cheese over the top of the potatoes. I thought, why not?! They tuned out silky and fantastic. We had young an old guest alike that raved over them and wanted to know what I put in them. I think next time I will go a little heavier on the garlic flavor (and these will be making an encore appearance on our Christmas table). Thanks for posting a keeper.

In fact, I had everything to make it at home, including the tiny geen lentilles vertes de Puy, although I think you could use any sort of lentils.

I used  veggie broth and almost didn't get to the second half of the recipe as the cooked little green lentils in the veggie broth with the sun dried tomatoes was so good alone, I could have stopped there and eaten just that.

The cake sat on display at an indoor reception in August without deflating, weeping, melting, whatever.  The clouds stayed puffy, the colors stayed put, and it tasted great still.  Whipped cream always tastes better chilled so I actually made a second sheet cake to keep in the fridge and served that while I returned the decorated one back in the fridge.  We actually ended up not having to serve that one but we sure did enjoy it later that day an it still looked beautiful after all that displaying and transferring.

I grew up in a small northern Indiana town and we had 3 drive-in hot dog stands...all unique in their own way. Spanish dogs were just a way of life there.  Each of these family-owned hot dog stands had their very own special home-made family recipe sauce and albiet close, each had it's own special taste...but all were great in their own way.  Some people were only west end sauce eaters...others strictly east end.  Then there were those south side saucies who dared to cross the tracks to the other side and away from the standard sauce of the region.  I know it sounds silly...but hot dog sauce was serious where I grew up.  MY POINT  I haven't lived in my home town for almost 20 years now...going back only now and then at which time we absolutely do not miss the opportunity to stop and get some spanish dogs.  I DON'T HAVE TO EVER WAIT TO GO HOME AGAIN!! I have attempted 4 other times with recipes that I thought might be a good substitute only to be disappointed.  YOU, my dear dear fellow zaarian, have hit the proverbial nail on the head!  It is not 100%...but let me tell you...99.99876% doesn't get any closer..and we'll take it!!  Ironically...that's the glory of dog sauce.  Each is unique in it's own way and yours falls right into place.  \\n\\nThe night I made this my husband and I sat at the table with our plate of dogs and not a word was spoken.  That said it all!!  With the exception of the ancho chili powder, which I could not find for my first batch but will for future batches, I followed your recipe word for word.  The one thing I did as far as technique was to take my stick blender (motor boat thingy) and make the sauce a smoother consistency to mimic our favorite south side sauce from back home. For anyone who wishes to partake in the glory of this dog sauce, may I suggest the traditional long skinnies (type of dog) and very hot steamed buns (slightly open buns, cut side down, wrapped in a kitchen towel on top of a cooling rack that you have placed over the pot of boiling dogs).  \\n\\nSo, in a nutshell I apologize for the book-length review, but there was really no other way to express to you our gratitude for your fantastic dog sauce recipe.  My freezer will never be without it for the rest of my cooking life!  Thanks again for your great trip down memory lane recipe! :)"},{"name":"crisp fried wild turkey breast","steps":"in a shallow bowl beat eggs , then add salt and pepper', 'tear strips of turkey off breastbone', 'dip turkey in eggs , then flour', 'bring oil to 375 degrees in a dutch oven or large stock pot , making allowance for the volume of the turkey , and fry turkey on medium-high until browned', 'cover dutch oven while frying to prevent splattering'","description":"an easy way to cook that wild turkey your mighty hunter brings home. from texas highways magazine posted in response to a recipe request. cooking time is approximate.","ingredients":"eggs', 'salt and pepper', 'turkey breast', 'flour', 'oil'","review":"Wonderful hot dog sauce...my BF thought this was just great.

I had to resort to using canned mangos as fresh mango is out of season right now, but the taste was still excellent. I recommend using red papaya rather than the orange as the taste is sweeter and it adds some great colour to the dessert. The crystallized ginger was a fantastic addition - everyone raved about it. I felt like the pudding was a bit too sweet, but my husband (a rice pudding officianado from way back) said that it was perfect. The only change I would make to this recipe would be to reduce the milk by a half a cup and add another half cup of coconut milk as I couldn't taste the coconut milk at all (though it did contribute to a lovely richness)."},{"name":"crispy batter for fish   chips","steps":"mix ingredients together', 'dip cod into batter', 'deep fry at 425f until cooked'","description":"a classic.  our whole family will eat fish this way!  i like to serve it with steak-cut french fries.","ingredients":"all-purpose flour', 'baking powder', 'salt', 'water', 'cod fish fillets'","review":"We are big scone fans, and I always like to have a batch in the freezer, well, this one never made it to the freezer!

To make matters worse, in the picture associated with the recipe, you can clearly see that there are ingredients (elbow noodles) in the soup that aren't even listed in the recipe.
