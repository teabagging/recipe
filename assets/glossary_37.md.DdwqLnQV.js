The chef got back to me and explained my ignorance of what a deep dish pie is.  I didn't even know that a WHOLE subcategory of pies with only top crusts exist!  \\n\\nI'm not sure I made this right because the crust was on top. For some reason, I was thinking it was supposed to sink to the bottom, like one of those Bisquik recipes. Except for that confusion, this is a great recipe. The topping/crust tastes kind of like a sugar cookie, but better. And the apples had the perfect amount of spice (I did add a little nutmeg, but that's just me...the total of the nutmeg/cinnamon mixture was 1 tablespoon). Unfortuneatly, I was out of pecans, but I was imagining the whole time how tasty it would be to have them in the crust!

I omitted the green onion, parsley and tomato (didn't have any) and substituted American cheese and multi-grain bread (because that's what I had.)  It was still really good, much better than tuna, mayo, mustard that I normally throw together.  I think the lemon pepper made all the difference.  Like I said, I will make this again with the ingredients I omitted .  Thanks Kittencal!

My husband dislikes tomatoes, so I left them out. Instead I got some leafy green lettuce and added it after the cheese melting stage. \\nWe also did ours in low-carb tortillas instead of the traditional bread. Best to put the tuna on an oven/microwave safe dish for melting the cheese because the first time we prepared this our tortillas got too stiff and crunchy while in the oven under the broiler. If you do it on a plate first, you can slide the tuna and cheese right onto a fresh, moist tortilla or wrap. Kudos for the use of lemon, too. Not only did it add a little zing to the tuna, to me it reduced the 'tuna-y' smell and if you're breaking up the pieces/draining by hand, you can rub the empty lemons on your hands to remove the scent. \\nThanks Kittencal for a great basic recipe!"},{"name":"carolina pulled pork inspired hamburgers","steps":"in a small sauce pan , fry half of the bacon pieces and the chopped onion in 1 tablespoon melted butter until the onions are golden , about 5 to 6 minutes', 'add honey , mustard , vinegar , hot sauce and worcestershire and simmer until the sauce thickens and slightly reduces , about 8-10 minutes', 'season with salt and pepper , to taste', 'while the sauce is cooking , fry the remaining bacon pieces until crisp then drain on paper towels', 'in a small mixing bowl , combine both paprikas , brown sugar , onion powder , garlic powder and celery seeds with 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper', 'lightly knead the ground pork with the bacon and liquid smoke in a bowl', 'loosely make 4 patties about 3 / 4 thick and place on a plate covered with saran wrap', 'sprinkle the spice mixture on the top , bottom and sides of burger , patting it into the meat till it sticks', 'brush the spice covered burgers and both sides of the bread with the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter', 'light your grill and brush the grate with oil once it is heated', 'grill the burgers for 12 minutes , turning once , until just cooked through', 'remove the burgers from direct heat and grill the bread on both sides until toasted and the grill marks appear', 'set each burger on a toast slice and top with the shredded cabbage and a generous helping of the honey-mustard sauce', 'cover with the remaining toasted bread and serve immediately , passing the extra sauce separately'","description":"i love pulled pork and had my doubts about a burger recipe with claims to compare. i was pleasantly surprised that this burger definitely does resemble the taste of our southern pulled pork and is actually a quite delicious & quick way to serve ground pork.  i was impressed with the inventiveness of this recipe and how the bland taste of the ground pork was elevated by simply adding bits of smoky bacon and smearing with a rub. obviously this will never be a substitute for real pulled pork, but in a pinch, when the mood strikes but lack of time persists, this succulent burger will certainly fit the bill! i have made these twice now, once using my george forman grill with excellent results. steven raichlen has done it again with this recipe! other then a few personal changes, this is his recipe from burgers. \\nalthough pale ales are the usual choice for bbq dishes, i tend to lean more towards the brown ales with pulled pork (or versions of it); try it with an abita turbo dog or sam smith‚Äôs nut brown. make ahead: the honey-mustard sauce can be made a day ahead of time and refrigerated, just reheat on low before serving.","ingredients":"bacon', 'onion', 'unsalted butter', 'honey', 'dijon mustard', 'cider vinegar', 'tabasco sauce', 'worcestershire sauce', 'salt & freshly ground black pepper', 'sweet paprika', 'hot paprika', 'dark brown sugar', 'onion powder', 'garlic powder', 'celery seed', 'ground lean pork', 'liquid smoke', 'vegetable oil', 'sandwich bread', 'green cabbage'","review":"I've made this recipe so many times the paper I printed it on is wearing out!

Everyone to whom I served it loves this: a great change of pace from macaroni and cheese - and healthier! THREE notes: ONE: for slightly-crunchy, non-mushy, cauliflower, put the raw pieces in a bowl while the water in your pot heats to a good boil. Then add the pieces, boil for only 10 minutes, and drain into a colander. If you're not going to add the sauce and eat immediately (without baking), rinse or soak the hot cauliflower in cold water to stop the cooking. Then, toss with the hot sauce and place in a buttered baking dish, with any desired topping, set aside, then later bake as directed in the recipe.\\n TWO: For those who have never made a bechamel sauce (butter, flour, milk) as in step 5, I suggest melting the butter alone in the saucepan, adding the flour and stirring it into a paste over low heat for 2 min. to get rid of the raw flour taste, then slowly adding milk while stirring with a fork, and the flour-butter (roux) will readily dissolve into the milk.\\n THREE: My broken up raw cauliflower filled up a 3-qt pot and I'm guessing the sauce could have been stretched for up 50% more."},{"name":"carrot cake  cake mix","steps":"preheat oven to 350 degrees', 'grease and flour a bundt pan', 'i use bakers joy spray', 'beat cake mix , water , oil , eggs and pineapple on low speed 3 minutes', 'stir in nuts and raisins', 'pour into prepared pan', 'bake for 50-55 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean', 'cool in pan 15 minutes', 'remove from pan and cool on wire rack', 'cool at least 1 hour before frosting'","description":"this is delicious, i started making it with a duncan hines carrot cake mix in the 1980's and had to switch to betty crocker when duncan stopped making it. i actually made it for miss picky's first birthday and she will be 25 in june. the pineapple and raisins really make it moist and the the chopped pecans add a different texture. try it with cream cheese frosting.","ingredients":"carrot cake mix', 'water', 'vegetable oil', 'eggs', 'crushed pineapple with juice', 'nuts', 'raisins'","review":"My mother would often make this dish when I was growing up in England.

I am under strict orders to make this again."},{"name":"carrot kugel","steps":"mix dry ingredients', 'add rest and bake for one hour at 325 degrees f'","description":"","ingredients":"plain flour', 'sugar', 'baking powder', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'cinnamon', 'lemon juice', 'carrots', 'eggs', 'oil'","review":"This was pretty good though I did find it a little bland. I bought an eye of round roast and had the butcher slice it into 1/4 inch slices so I could leave the meat a little pink in the middle. I think with a few extra seasonings in the flour it would definitely be a five star. But it was quick and easy and the kids loved it! EDIT: Any leftovers make great cold sandwiches with a bit of spicy mustard. EDIT #2: I tried this again with garlic (about 2 TBS), onion powder (1 TBS), paprika (1 TBS), and ancho chile powder (1 tsp) and it was EXCELLENT!"},{"name":"carrot latkes","steps":"clean , scrape , and grate carrots', 'transfer to a large sieve , and press against them to drain any liquid', 'allow to drain for approximately 10 minutes', 'beat eggs in a large bowl', 'add drained carrots , the finely chopped scallion , garlic , salt and pepper to taste', 'mix , and add enough matza meal so that the mixture is pretty firm when shaped into a pancake', 'heat oil in skillet over medium heat', 'using about 2 tablespoons of the carrots mixture for each , drop the latkes into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides', 'remove from skillet and drain on paper towels', 'serve , garnishing with sour cream and chopped scallions'","description":"another take on this favorite hanukkah tradition.  this recipe is posted for the world tour 2005 recipezaar event.  i haven't had a chance to try these yet, but know i will enjoy them.\\nthe source is the hadassah jewish holiday cookbook - traditional recipes from contemporary kosher kitchens.  this particular recipe was contributed by abe koblin, dayan group, baltimore hadassah.","ingredients":"carrot', 'eggs', 'scallion', 'garlic clove', 'salt', 'pepper', 'matzo meal', 'oil', 'sour cream'","review":"This easily deserves 5 stars. I had leftover beef drippings, but not quite 1/2 cup -- so I made up the difference with lard (yes, good ol' lard!). They came out perfect.
