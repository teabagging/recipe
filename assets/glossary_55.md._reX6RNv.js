HOWEVER... the ingredients on my tomato sauce (Muir Glen organic) are just tomatoes, water, and salt - no sugar, no HFCS - and even Hunts doesn't have as much sugar as Heinz. The amount of sugar added to this recipe is just 1/4 TEASPOON - negligible at best - but you can always add an equal amount of Kosher salt to cut the sweet edge of that sugar and still get the rounded palette flavor. <br/><br/>That said, we are a household with Celiac and food allergies to accommodate, so processed sauces are hazardous to our health. This is one of the easiest sauces with best taste that I've found for tacos and enchiladas - and having lived all over the SW and in TX, I'm pretty picky about what's passable for Mexican cuisine.  That said, I made the following modifications:<br/><br/>Instead of garlic powder, I used fresh garlic with garlic oil.<br/>Instead of dried minced onion, I used onion powder to get the deeper flavor.<br/>I added salt to taste to balance out the sweetness. <br/><br/>My husband has decided that (just as with the BBQ sauce I make that is probably closer to Bone Sucking Sauce than any widely available brand), he wants me to make this taco sauce in bulk and keep it on hand, rather than him using the processed stuff -- and he is the one with NO allergies and NO Celiac."},{"name":"cinnamon swirl pear bread","steps":"combine the pears , 1 / 2 cup of water and 1 / 2 cup of sugar in a saucepan', 'simmer , uncovered for 10 minutes or until tender', 'drain well , but reserve the syrup', 'add cold water , if necessary , to syrup to measure 1 cup', 'set aside', 'in a mixing bowl , dissolve yeast in warm water', 'add 1 tsp sugar', 'let stand for 10 minutes', 'add eggs , butter , honey , salt , almond extract , 4 cups of flour and reserved pears and syrup', 'beat until smooth', 'add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough', 'turn onto a floured surface , knead for 6-8 minutes , or until smooth and elastic', 'place in a greased bowl , turning once to grease the top', 'cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 1 / 4 hours , or until doubled', 'punch dough down , divide into thirds', 'roll each portion into a 16 x 8 inch rectangle', 'combine cinnamon and 3 / 4 cup sugar , sprinkle over dough within 1 / 2 inch of edges', 'roll up , jelly-roll style , starting with a short side', 'pinch seams to seal', 'place seam side down , in 3 greased 9x5x3 inch loaf pans', 'cover and let rise until doubled , about 45 minutes', 'bake 375 for 20 minutes , and then cover loosely with foil', 'bake 15 to 20 minutes longer , or until bread tests done', 'let loaves cool on wire racks'","description":"i found this in an old taste of home magazine i had.","ingredients":"pears', 'water', 'sugar', 'active dry yeast', 'warm water', 'eggs', 'butter', 'honey', 'salt', 'almond extract', 'all-purpose flour', 'ground cinnamon'","review":"If you don't think this taste exactly like taco bells mild sauce you made it wrong...

I made them for my son and he loves them! One thing I did learn from a different recipe (that came to light while making these) is that letting the batter sit for about ten minutes while your pan heats up... its almost crucial when you have a soupier batter. I also did it a little different, I sifted all the dry stuff together and then i mixed all the wet stuff together in another bowl and poured that in while stirring. This caused a soupier mixture but after 10-15 minutes of cooking 1-3 pancakes at a time the batter started to thicken just from sitting out. And the pancakes were much fluffier after that (the first few came out almost flat). So now i have tweaked the recipe and these are perfect and delicious! I disagree with the only negative comment on the page, i tried one of these without any toppings and they were bland-ish. But when served with syrup as most people eat pancakes the flavor was delicious and you can taste the butter and flavor in the pancakes when accompanied by delicious syrup. These are GREAT!

I then brushed with an egg wash and slashed the tops before baking.  I think this is a good recipe, but I must strongly emphasize that the claims to this dough being able to last 5 days in the fridge are ridiculous!  I would say, based on my experience, that these rolls should be baked within 24 hours after the dough goes into the fridge; no longer.  Otherwise, the dough develops an off taste that definitely comes through in the finished item.  Oh, and I did knead the dough for about 5 minutes before I stashed it.  I only brushed with butter after they came out of the oven, and of course, as I do with all my rolls, I gave them a light shower of kosher salt as well.

DH made this and forgot to grind the cashews into paste, so I think that the sauce was more liquid because of this,  but never mind we LOVED the sauce.

We didn't add the optional panir or kasuri menthi because we didn't have them and we used fresh ginger finely grated instead of ginger paste, all I can say this that this is flavour like a bolt of lightening, so don't let the long list of ingredients put you off, it's all worth it! \\nWe served ours with plain white rice for an excellent meal that we agreed we will be making again.. soon!

I'm assuming the intention is to lay the cheese over the chicken breasts, which seems counter productive, as it would make the coating on the chicken mushy and keep it from crisping up like it should.  I used bone in chicken breast.  I assume this is what the recipe intends, since the long bake time would be too much for boneless, skinless chicken.  I pulled the skin off some of the breasts to reduce the fat, and both types turned out moist and delicious.  We used 6 HUGE chicken breasts.  Only 4 fit in a 9 by 13 pan!  The other two went into a square pan, and I made 1/2 a recipe of sauce for them, with chicken broth instead of wine.  Both ways turned out well.  The bake time was pretty close to right on for the large chicken breasts, so if using smaller ones, be sure to start checking the chicken before the hour is up.   I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours in some white wine, salt, pepper, and fresh thyme.  I also added salt to the bread crumbs and salt and pepper to the flour, because our chicken breast was not injected with any sort of salt solution, and the recipe did not call for any salt.  I think it might be pretty bland otherwise.

The first night, I had difficulty removing the cooked onion/pepper-beef-cheese from the pan to transfer to the bun.  Tonight, I pulled out another pan to warm the beef and melt the cheese; it was easier for me to get everything to the sandwich.  I used hot dog rolls on night one, and thin-sliced Pepperidge Farm sandwich bread on night two;  I'm sure the hoagie rolls would have tasted much better, but I had too much bread on hand already.

These were sure the hit of our family picnic today! I've never had more compliments/recipe requests on a recipe in my life! I had quite a time crushing the Oreos to coffee ground size because my blender wasn't working with me much, but I was determined not to let any lumps slip by and put in the extra time to get it done right. It was certainly worth it too! I had purchased white almond bark for the white ones, not noticing that it was vanilla flavored. I really didn't like those ones at all and threw them out, then made that half of my second batch with white chocolate chips. Those turned out very tasty and the chocolate ones were just unbelievable! Yum! Lastly, I used DebS lovely picture as a reference  (since the blue seems to really add to the Oreo theme somehow) and added a few drops of food coloring to some of the white chocolate chip drizzled ones. It was a beautiful presentation and a special little treat!

I couldn't find white almond bark.  So I used Wilton melting chocolate instead since I had it around anyway for other goodies I was making.  \\n\\nAt first I wasn't sure if I was making them right, because the oreo mixture was pretty mushed- but I did find it easier to keep the balls in the freezer for a while before dipping them into the melting chocolate. I also made them smaller since they were rich, as suggested by a few other reviewers; plus dipping them in the chocolate adds to the size.  I got about 50+ balls from one recipe. However, I am sure that no one would complain if they were bigger! \\n\\nMaking the mixture is incredible easy using a food processor- I made sure my cream cheese was very soft. Forming the balls is easy if you use a small cookie scooper that helps pop them out, since it's rather sticky. If you're looking for perfect circles, your hands will get a bit messy when rolling themm in your hands (but I would suggest chilling them beforehand). The only real time consuming part was dipping them in the chocolate one by one.

This produced super crunchy biscotti with a really nice mild pumpkin flavor.  I was guessing at the pinch size, and probably added a bit more clove and ginger than called for but it made for a really tasty cookie.

However, I ran into another problem that had nothing to do with that and is worth commenting on. I wish that all recipe posters would include weights as well as counts. The four zucchini I used weighed about 3 lbs. total. I don't know if that means that they weren't medium, but it was definitely way too much zucchini for the rest of the ingredients; the amount of meat sauce was especially low compared to the amount of zucchini. I think it would help to use only about a pound and a half of zucchini. The big problem, however, came from an inescapable fact about zucchini: it is composed primarily of water. When I took the pan out of the oven, the casserole was floating in a noticeable layer of water. I poured off at least a cup. Once more during the 10-minute resting period, I poured off more, and then again just before I dished up my serving. All told, I poured off a good 2 cups of clear liquid, and the casserole was still plenty moist when I ate it. Maybe with about half as much zucchini, the water that bakes out would be incorporated into the sauce more, but I'm afraid it would still be a rather gooshy dish."},{"name":"claussen kosher pickle copycat","steps":"slice cucumbers lengthwise into quarters', 'add to sterilized jars along with the dill', 'boil liquids and seasonings to dissolve the salt then cool', 'pour over pickles and let sit on counter for three days shaking or turning them occasionally ,', 'refrigerate', 'he said they keep for a year', 'please do not try to use the regular grocery store cucumbers , they have wax on them and they will not turn out', 'you can use grocery store pickling cucumbers as they are not waxed'","description":"two weeks ago i was in the grocery store and a man was buying fresh dill.  we started talking and he said he was making claussen clone pickles (my favorite) i asked him to call me with the recipe and he did and this is it.  his name is joe knutowski. he uses his old ice cream pails to pack them in instead of gallon jars. i make these alot in pickle season and they have stayed good into the spring and  they are really a close copycat.","ingredients":"cucumber', 'instant minced onion', 'garlic cloves', 'mustard seeds', 'fresh dill', 'water', 'cider vinegar', 'canning salt'","review":"I just have a comment for people wanting to make this recipe....You should probably boil the zucchini before using it in this.
