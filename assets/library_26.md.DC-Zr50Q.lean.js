I would advise to use an 8 inch tortilla, at least. I used 1/4 c cheese, 1/2 c filling and 1/4 c cheese to fill the wraps that we had and I wound up getting 10 chimichangs (and my skinny, little, tweenaged son ate 5 of them). The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star rating is because after I used 8 slices of bacon, I couldn't taste it at all in the finished product. I'm not sure if that is how it is supposed to be but I was kind of bummed out about it. My husband (the World's Biggest Bacon Fan) was devastated because that is why he chose this recipe. Other than that, they were pretty good. They even heated up well in the microwave the next day and the shell even stayed nice and crispy. Thank you for posting. We will most likely make this again."},{"name":"pizza dough for pizza or calzones  bread machine","steps":"[place all ingredients except cornmeal into your bread machine according to your manufacturer's directions, 'for my bread machine it is in the order listed above', 'once dough cycle has finished , turn dough out onto a floured surface', 'preheat oven to 400f and roll or stretch dough out into a 12 inch round or several small rounds or a large rectangle', 'place pizza on a greased cookie sheet', 'sprinkle cornmeal over top of dough', 'bake pizza for 10 minutes at 400f', 'remove from oven and cover with toppings', 'reduce oven temp to 350f and bake 10 minutes or until cheese is bubbly and browned'","description":"a bread machine makes having homemade pizza as easy as using a storebought pizza! i use this for pizzas and calzones. prep and cook time do not include time in dough cycle.  my dough cycle is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.\\nthis recipe makes a ton of dough if you like a thinner crust like me, it makes 1 large thick crust pizza, it also makes six 6-inch calzones.  it is crispy and flavorful, i like to sub some whole wheat flour for real artisan taste!","ingredients":"beer', 'sugar', 'salt', 'butter', 'garlic powder', 'onion powder', 'italian seasoning', 'bread flour', 'bread machine yeast', 'cornmeal'","review":"I used burrito sized tortillas, and they were the perfect size.

So when I boiled up a whole chicken today and was trying to figure out what to do with it after pulling everything off the bones and shredding it, I came across this recipe.  It did not disappoint.  I had to tweak the recipe a little based on what I had on hand.  Didn&#039;t weigh/measure my meat, just used about half of the chicken. I didn&#039;t add the bacon, so instead just sauteed the onion in some butter, then added the green chilies and meat.  And instead of using the spices listed, I cheated and just used a package of taco seasoning with a little water.  Didn&#039;t have fresh tomatoes, so used a 1/4 cup or so of petite diced tomatoes, drained.  Had made some Rotel cheese dip the other night for a tex-mex dinner, so topped chimis with that after pulling them out of the grease.  Even my picky 6 y/o daughter said they were good and didn&#039;t even notice the tomatoes in the meat.  I made 3 with large burrito-size tortillas and 1 smaller, soft taco-size tortilla (for my 6 y/o).  Have some of the meat mixture left over, so I&#039;m thinking chicken tacos tomorrow maybe . . ."},{"name":"pizza dough for thin crust pizza","steps":"mix a little sugar into the warm water', 'sprinkle yeast on top', 'wait for 10 minutes or until it gets all foamy', 'pour into a large bowl', 'add flour , salt , olive oil', 'combine', 'knead for 6-8 minutes until you have a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic', 'cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes', 'lightly grease two 12-inch pizza pans', 'sprinkle with a little bit of cornmeal', 'divide dough in half', 'place each half on a pizza pan and pat it with your fingers until it stretches over the whole pan', 'try to make it thicker around the edge', 'if desired , pre-bake at 425 f for 10 minutes', 'then spread with pizza sauce and use the toppings of your choice', 'bake at 425 f for 10-20 minutes longer or until bubbly and hot', 'makes 2 12-inch pizzas', if you don't want to use all the dough , you can freeze it, 'take a portion of dough , form into a ball , rub olive oil over it and place it in a freezer bag', 'when you want to make a pizza , take dough out of freezer and allow to thaw before using'","description":"note:this is one of the recipes i adopted in the great 'zaar ophan adoption of 2005. i hope you enjoy it.","ingredients":"all-purpose flour', 'active dry yeast', 'salt', 'warm water', 'olive oil', 'cornmeal'","review":"I just can't seem to help myself when it comes to modifying recipes but the changes were pretty minor.

Using a food processor really is the way to go in my opinion. I did use half salted and half unsalted butter to solve the salt problem and it came out perfect for me. I also recommend cutting the shortbread as soon as it comes out of the oven. I know it's hot but it seemed like the longer it cooled, the more brittle it got when it went under the knife. Found hot fingers to be less painful than cracking shortbread! Tried to use this as a base for my holiday cookies, but found that adding things tended to make the end result extremely brittle. I'm going to give it a try again with the early cutting method and see if that improves my success rate. It doesn't really need additions, hence the five stars!

Well, make these cookies and let them sit for 24 hours, and you wind up with Subway cookies!\\n\\nI made them once, and based on reviews, I knew I'd done something wrong ; they were quite hard and crunchy.  Figures, my crunchy-cookie-lovin' husband thought they were pretty good.  I realized I'd shorted the amount of butter needed, so I promptly made another batch.  Now, I'm all for soft cookies, but these are way too soft at first.  When removing them from the cookie sheet, I had to be very careful because they were practically the consistency of uncooked batter!  Once they cooled a bit, they did firm up, but they were still too soft for me.  Now, the next morning, they were UNREAL!  That's when they hit Yowza status, as in Yowza, this is good stuff!\\n\\nMy first batch, I used chocolate pudding and chocolate chips; besides being too hard because I messed up, it was a tad too much chocolate for my taste.  The next batch, I used butterscotch pudding and chocolate chips... very tasty, indeed!  Next go-round, I'll be trying chocolate pudding with white chocolate chunks, as that's really my favorite flavor of cookie.\\n\\nOne tip for people planning to make this recipe... if you like a thinner cookie, definitely spread out the batter, as these are not cookies that really flatten and spread out while baking.  They do a little, but if you put the dough in balls on the sheet, your cookies will be fairly thick.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, this is one heck of a cookie recipe, and I appreciate you sharing it!  Definitely going into my recipe binder, and I'll be making these cookies for years to come.  Wonderful that you can switch things up by using different puddings and chips.

This recipe really came in handy! The cookies have a rich, fudgy, kind of brownie-like texture and are great. (And I didn't even add the solid chocolate pieces to the dough.) I've got three recommendations for my fellow bakers, though. 1. When you beat the eggs after adding the sugar, keep in mind that soft marshmallow creme means that the batter will still be a little bit runny, but it'll be okay. (I kept waiting for it to firm up more.) 2. Do grease your pans as the recipe indicates! I rarely grease cookie pans, and my cookies almost always turn out fine, but as these are a little lower in fat than most cookies, they will stick to the pan if it isn't lightly lubricated. 3. If you plan on making the recipe in batches, be aware that the dough dries out very quickly. I only used one pan for the first batch, so I still had some dough leftover. By the time I got to use the pan again, the dough was starting to dry out. If it dries out too much, I would probably cover the dough with a damp paper towel and stick it in the microwave for a couple of seconds (it seems to work for other foods that have lost some of their moisture).

Next time I think I may use half Velveeta and half cream cheese, adding the latter at the end of the cooking process."},{"name":"platte county fair kraut burgers","steps":"divide chuck into thirds', 'then divide each third into half , and flatten them out into 6 patties', 'place 1 / 3 cup sauerkraut on each of 3 patties', 'top with the other 3 patties , being sure to seal well around the edges', 'sprinkle with steak seasoning', 'grill until done', 'place each burger on a bun and top with mustard or your favorite topping'","description":"platte county in missouri, usa is known for it's kraut burgers. time and convenience have changed the way they serve them, but this is the old-fashioned way that everyone remembers from their childhood. with the exception of the seasoning, which is my touch. even non-kraut lovers like these.","ingredients":"ground chuck', 'sauerkraut', 'hamburger buns', mccormick's montreal brand steak seasoning]","review":"On the whole I enjoyed this a lot.

I don&#039;t know that mine came out like Stroganoff, but was more like SOS. However, I did like it and will probably make it again at some point. I chose this because it seemed fast and easy, but I did make some changes based on what I had read in the reviews and also on what I had on hand. I feared it would be a little on the bland side with the way it was written so I upped the amounts of all the spices and onion. I also did not have tomato paste so rather than leave it out (which I may consider next time), I subbed some tomato sauce. I didn&#039;t use much, but I was a little scared when I saw that it made my sauce a rosy hue!. I also added in a touch of worcestershire sauce per regular stroganoff recipes, careful not to add too much. Maybe a little more than 1/2 tsp.? I used fresh mushrooms because I had a partial open container that I needed to use. I used more chicken broth than was called for as well. After measuring out the one cup for the sauce, I used a little to add to the pan while my chicken was finishing cooking so the pan didn&#039;t get too dry (before I added in the sauce ingredients). It ensured my chicken stayed tender and my pan didn&#039;t dry out. When my sauce was done simmering and it was time to add in the sour cream, I used Mexican Crema because that&#039;s what I had and it was awesome! The rosy hue that I was worried about mellowed out (as well as probably the tomato-y flavor) and my sauce was really creamy. I served mine over steamed rice and it was delish! &lt;br/&gt;*Note~ If you have never tried Mexican style sour cream, do yourself a favor and run to the store right now and get some!

I had anticipated something fruitier or sweeter, but the more I ate it the more I liked it. My husband had the same reaction. He wasn't so sure about it at first bite, but when he went back for a second try, he couldn't get enough of it. I would say this is definitely a dinner party recipe, rather than one for a family meal becasue of the rarity and expense of the ingredients. I had a hard time getting them all in my house at once. (My pomegranate was getting old by the time I found a jicama, etc.) Also because it makes so much and doesn't stay good for long after you dress it, it seems better suited for entertaining to me.

When I made the dressing I also used more sugar so that it would be a bit sweeter, and used more olive oil than called for.  I put the cilantro in the Cuisinart with the dressing ingredients because I like it chopped very fine.  I used romaine hearts instead of arugula - prefer the mellower flavor.

I absolutely love this recipe and have also read every comment and couldn't agree more with each one. It's not the quality of the recipe that some were disappointed in ,rather the lack of precise detailed information that was so dearly needed in the ingredients as well as directions. The acid contained in bottled lemon juice already contains the preservatives needed . If you prefer it to be without lemon you can replace it with white distilled vinegar 5 0/0 acidity. Vinegar along with salt work together in preserving foods. It's also a very good idea to always bring it to a boil for at least 15 minutes. Turning heat down as needed to med high heat stirring occasionally. That's why I don't drain my tomato juice, because it will vaporize within the 15 minutes. To avoid any sticking , I always rather use the natural juice from fresh vegetables and keep the flavor instead of possibly having to dilute it with water . It's important to cook your ingredients to keep from any spoilage and risk of any food poisoning.

To be fair, others have given good reviews, so maybe this would have worked out better if I'd used different brands of ingredients.  I don't know.  The large biscuit dough I used was definitely not large enough to hold anywhere near 1/3 cup of filling, so what I ended up with was more like little appetizers rather than something you'd serve as a meal.  The salsa made the mix too watery and it kept leaking out, so I'd recommend draining the salsa first, or perhaps adding it to the meat in the pan and letting the excess water/juice evaporate before trying to fill the dough.  And perhaps it was the brand of biscuit dough that I used, but I found it incredibly difficult to work with.  It was so oily that I had a very hard time getting the edges to stay sealed.  Even when I crimped them with a fork, they just kept opening right back up.  The filling itself was good, and I think I might like this made using bread dough.  I think if I'd made some bread dough in my bread machine and used that instead of the biscuit dough, this might have turned out much better (and healthier, too).  I had doubled the recipe, thinking that I was going to get to put some of these up for later, but this was so much trouble that I ended up stopping halfway through and freezing the rest of the mix to use in a Tex-Mex casserole or something.  Maybe I'll make the bread dough and use the filling for that.

I had some fresh coriander in the fridge (the Asia shop sells them in huge bunches) which I roughly chopped and added four or five tablespoon to the salad.
