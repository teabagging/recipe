I just made this for the first time, and it is a great BASIC recipe. It lacks proper seasoning and needs some general bedazzling. The recipe makes a small pie, and I was feeding a bunch so I tripled the crust, doubled the filling, and used a 9x13 glass pan. No matter how much you make, I would increase the amount of crust stated in the recipe. I used about 2 cups of turkey (light and dark meat) and about 1 cup of ham, but wish I had switched the ratios and used more ham than turkey. I added some squash casserole and a few leftover carrots to the filling, but wanted more vegetables. It needs a LOT more vegetables to fill it out and give it some texture. The cheese/egg mixture is a good ratio, but is very bland with just the gravy to season it. I used extra gravy, salt, pepper, garlic powder and parsley. I did not use the cranberry sauce on top, but I would probably just blend in a spoonful with the seasoning for flavor, not sweetness, if I did use it. This could be a 5 STAR conversation starter with a few changes. 1) Increase the ratio of crust to filling. 2) Season the cheese/egg mixture before adding meat or veggies! 3) Increase the amount of meat, and note that ham will have more flavor than turkey. 4) Add some veggies! Trust me, the texture/flavor is not quite right without them. At least 1 cup if the recipe is made as written, more if increased.
