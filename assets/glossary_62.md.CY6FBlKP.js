I replaced half the oil with unsweetened applesauce and those were the only changes I planned on making. Then I realized I didn't have enough sugar and I wasn't able to go to town right then. :( I ended up using 1 1/2 cups each of white and brown sugar. When I got to the amount of pumpkin pie spice, I was concerned 2 Tbls. was an error. My container said to use 2 tsp. per 2 cups of pumpkin puree for a pie so I decided to err on the side of two little spice than too much and used 2 tsp. The bread could have used a little more spice but I still think 2 Tbls. would have been too spice for my family. We enjoyed the bread. I think using the full amount of sugar would have made it too sweet. I thought the cranberries really complimented the spicy pumpkin flavor. The only problem I had with the recipe was the pan size. My loaves overflowed the 8x4 pans quite a bit. Maybe if you use the full 4 cups of sugar it makes it a denser bread and they don't rise as high, but I made sure to put a note on my printout to use my 9x5 loaf pans next time.

I'm guessing that the size of the potatoes, the size of the chunks and the size of the pan all make a difference in how this dish turns out.  \\nEither way it's good and a great way for a busy mom to get a hot breakfast to herself.  The 45 minute cooking time really helps in that respect, everyone is done eating so I can just sit and enjoy... :)"},{"name":"crawfish and egg salad","steps":"to cook crawfish:', 'in a saucepan bring 2 quarts water to boil with 2 tsp salt and 1 / 2 tsp of red pepper', 'add peeled crawfish tails to water', 'bring to boil and remove from heat immediately', 'drain and cool', 'chop hard-boiled eggs', 'chop crawfish and mix with eggs', 'add pickles', mix mustard , durkee's , and mayonnaise and add to egg mixture, 'if needed , add more pepper and salt'","description":"","ingredients":"eggs', durkee's sauce, 'crawfish', 'mayonnaise', 'salt', 'dill pickles', 'red cayenne pepper', 'grey poupon'","review":"these were good i really like it,had to add onions,and basil and salt an pepper,now my family really like them.i like them the way they were. the potatoe did not brown that good thanks for the recipe"},{"name":"crawfish bisque","steps":"heat soup pot at medium heat', 'finely chop bacon , onions , garlic , celery hearts then throw in heated pot', 'saut until bacon browns and onions become transparent', 'cut butter and melt', 'sprinkle in flour and whisk to make paste add more if needed', 'cook 2 minutes , stirring frequently', 'add wine and stir to get out lumps', 'add crawfish cook for 5 minutes add bay leaves stirring 1 minute add stock stirring slowly , add mashed potatoes and seasoning', 'stir well to incorporate pots', 'simmer 30 minutes add cream and simmer 5 minutes', 'serve with a crusty bread', 'this works just as well with lobster'","description":"yummy creamy goodness.","ingredients":"bacon', 'yellow onion', 'celery heart', 'garlic cloves', 'butter', 'white wine', 'flour', 'crawfish', 'chicken broth', 'bay leaves', 'paprika', 'cajun seasoning', 'heavy cream', 'mashed potatoes'","review":"This recipe was easy, but I found it didn't have much flavor."},{"name":"crawfish boulets","steps":"in a 2-qt', 'bowl , combine butter , onion , bell pepper , celery , and garlic', 'mix well', 'saute onion mixture 4-5 minutes until tender', 'add paprika , cajun seasoning , eggs , bread crumbs , and chopped crawfish tails', 'mix well', 'if too dry , add a little water', 'if too moist , add more bread crumbs', 'form into balls and roll in flour', 'deep fry at 350 degrees until they float', 'remove and place on paper towels to drain', 'serve with or without a sauce of your liking'","description":"from the edible heirlooms cookbook.  i have not tried these appetizers yet, but hope to try them soon for a football party.","ingredients":"butter', 'onion', 'bell pepper', 'celery', 'garlic cloves', 'paprika', 'cajun seasoning', 'eggs', 'breadcrumbs', 'crawfish tail', 'flour'","review":"These were great!

We thought the pizza would be too plain because there are no pepperonis or stuff. So, we added pepperonis. No. Since pepperonis are too big for a teeny tiny pizza, we used THIN slices of smoked sausages instead of pepperonis. For the pizza sauce, we mixed pasta sauce with a little bit of tomato paste & a sprinkle of dried ground herbs. The pizza was very good! Really. The pepperonis cooked well.

He thought this was wonderful and definately wants it again and often.  He even said it was guest worthy, which one does not usually say of a stew.  I only used 2 1/2 1bs. of stew meat (already cut up) which worked out just fine because we love lots of sauce.  I used a fabulous bottle of 2001 BV costal cabernet, which was also wonderful.  I followed your directions completely except that after adding the carrots I cooked for an hour because the carrots took that long to get the way we like them.  I also added a couple of handfuls of frozen peas at the end.  In my mind I think mashed potatoes should go with beef stew, so I made potatoes and egg noodles.  I must add that the flavor was way more enhanced by the noodles and I won't make potatoes with it again.  Like other reviewers I did not need to add the cornstarch it was perfect without it.

It was a winner!! I substituted 1 cup of red wine vinegar for the red wine, and even managed to track down the hoisin sauce.  The dried herbs make a real difference to the delicate flavour of this dish, and I added a tablespoon of tomato paste. This is one of our family favourites, and it is great to find a recipe that can be left simmering on the stove.  The carrots add a sweetness, and when I served the dish I was pleased to see that they had not desintigrated into nothing, as they were added at a later stage.  Also nice to serve some hot French bread to enjoy the flavourful gravy.

We followed the recipe exactly to Step #8, using a nice cabernet.   At that point, we put the cocotte in the oven at 250 for 3 hours.  We then caramelized the carrots over high heat (not fully cooking them through) and set them aside.  Everything smelled and looked so good, we also caramelized  a package of frozen pearl onions and (separately) about a dozen quartered new potatoes. (Again, just for color, not fully cooked).  We added the vegetables, along with the cornstarch slurry, after the meat had cooked slowly for three hours.  20 minutes later, the stew was perfect!  The meat and sauce were divine, and the vegetables were just a bit al dente, with a very rustic  appearance from the prior caramelization.  (Sure beats mushy veggies the same color as the sauce!) When we poured the leftover wine with dinner, we realized the second cup (Step #11) had never made it into the dish.  But, with the slow cooking and without that extra liquid, the sauce was the perfect consistency as it was.  We ate it as a stew with some corn fritters, but plan to enjoy some of the leftovers over buttered noodles.  We'll definitely be making this one again.

Increased to 4 garlic cloves and also added a cup of beef stock as it was quite thick when braising.  Also, I started this in the morning, simmered it for two hours and turned it off until I returned home from work.  Didn't do the crock pot as it usually turns meat chunks into threads sitting in soup.   Simmered it another couple of hours with the additional wine.  Overall, I think I decreased the wine by about half as my glass was precariously close to the pot and some of the wine slipped into my glass.  I also added fresh ground pepper to the meat as well as the stew while simmering and omitted basil and oregano.  I also added about a half teaspoon of liquid smoke.

Mine always turns out very good. I do not mean this comment to be ugly at all so please don't take it that way. I dice my chicken breast up and set it aside.

Once the onions are translucent I add the diced chicken back to the skillet and cook until the chicken is done, add some diced tomatoes. Fresh basil cut into ribbons and oregano chopped up. Once the tomatoes have cooked down enough to get the can taste out I add hunts garlic and herb spagetti sauce, my cheat, and S &amp; P to taste. Once that comes to a boil I cut it down on simmer and leave it there for about 30-45 min. Really the longer you let it simmer the better it is because it gives all the flavors time to come together. I keep chicken broth or stock on the side in case the sauce starts getting to thick you can a little bit to loosen it up. When the sauce starts tasting to your liking put on the pasta in salty water, not to salty, and take it up when it becomes aldente. Add the pasta to the sauce. Stir or toss together and that's all I do. Make sure to continuously taste in case you need to add more S&amp;P or Italian seasoning.

It was hard to keep from scraping the pan clean with the spatula to get the last bit of creamy goodness.  (OK, it was impossible). But, I found a couple of things problematic when making them - I don't know if these were my fault or the recipe's.  1) There was too much onion for the amount of chicken filling.  It's possible my onion was more of a large than a medium.  2) I couldn't get all of the flour to dissolve in the milk mixture.  I finally gave up whisking with some lumps left, and they weren't noticeable once the cheese was melted in.  Maybe cornstarch would dissolve more easily since there's no roux to slowly add the milk to.  3) The sour cream wouldn't spread on top.  I stirred it to get it somewhat creamy, and then spooned it on. I tried to spread, but ended up pushing too much sauce over the edges, so I gave up & left the dollops.   Maybe thinning with a bit of milk would solve this.
