(We did let the cake get stale, the better to soak up the other ingredients) At a rough guess, I think they worked out to about 100 calories per ball; that is for the approximately 36 balls that we got using our melonballer to scoop them out. The main reason we chose this recipe was to avoid the use of commercial cookie or wafer crumbs, which generally contain hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats; the dreaded trans fatty acids.

Clorox did get it off my formica counter top, sink and faucet (all are white). I also had to go out and get several of the spices. Cardamon is very expensive but interestingly, the McCormick brand at Stop & Shop was $15, the 365 Whole Foods brand was $10 and the Organic Whole Foods brand was $7 so worth pricing it at Whole Foods if you need this spice.

I also altered the method in that I started by sauteing the onion (maybe 1/2c) in ghee with a bit of asafetida and most of the spices. Then added the lentils and broth. Since I was using whole cardamon pods I added them with the bay leaves. Let it simmer gently for half an hour before removing the bay leaves and adding 1c finely diced carrots and 1c finely diced celery. I let the soup simmer for another hour or more before removing the cardamon pods, only because I had time, it probably wasn't necessary.

OUTSTANDING.  My husband and his friend LOVED this dish.  Thank you very much for posting it here.\\n I thought the basic recipe was excellent but I made a few changes and wanted to mention one thing.  First off, I used half-and-half plus two TB of cream cheese.  That way it lowered the calories but kept a nice creamy mouth feel.  I also, like another reviewer, diced instead of grated my onions.  I used Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan because I LOVE it and I used a mixture of green, white, and red tortellini.  Also, I don't know how many people have tried them, but Trader Joes sells bags of frozen artichokes and they are FAR superior to any canned brand that I have tasted. Do try them if you get the chance.  Finally, at the end just before serving I drizzled about a TB of Black Truffle oil into the dish.  It was creamy, cheesy, earthy and yummy!

They were very quick to mix up and smelled so delicious while they were baking!  I made just a half recipe since I was low on oatmeal and used 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1/4 cup oat bran since I was shorter on oatmeal than I thought.  My small orange yielded 1 tsp of grated zest so that is the amount I put in my half batch.  I also used sweetened dried cranberries instead of raisins.  I divided the dough into 12 equal portions and baked them on parchment instead of greasing the pan.  I don't think I flattened them down quite enough, they were maybe 3/4 inch instead of the 1/2 thick the directions called for and I found they took much longer to bake than stated, maybe because they were too thick.  Took 21 minutes in my oven.  They also were slightly soft, with the crunch being more from the almonds than anything else but they were delicious all the same.  While they were cooling, a couple disappeared and I accused the dog but it turned out to be a 2 legged cookie tester who has already asked me to make them again.  I wasn't sure that I liked the texture of these so I am giving it only 4 stars but the two legged tester thinks they are a 5 in every way.  I can see lots of possibilities for tweaking on this one.

Once everything was mixed I should have known better than to put all the batter in one pan.  It was way too much.  I think this may have worked if I had kept the portions smaller and made about 4 smaller portions.  That being said, I did like the flavor of the mash that I ended up with (DH did not but hea?s not a fan of hazlenuts) and will probably give this another try with grating the hazelnuts first then measuring 2 Tbsp.

I 'm thinking my quantity of Amaretto was higher then the recipes - I just poured: ) I sauted the apples seperately with butter, spices and more Amaretto and a little water. This allowed both of us to enjoy them with our syrups, and I know for me if I had cooked the apples in the syrup it might have been too sweet. We both like that the syrup was sweet with out being edgy - sicky sweet, I don't know if it's the butter or liquor that mellows it, but it's delish!  \\nWe found the cake part of the pancakes to be a bit dry and rather bland, so I added a little extra sugar, more spice along with some nutmeg and vanilla, this helped except for the dryness, I think a little more butter in the batter would help or maybe grating the apples instead of dicing.

Prep time, including browning of lamb shanks, was about 1 1/2 hrs.  I used 3 moderately priced bottles of cabernet sauvignon, which seemed to work out fine.  However, I found 6 cups of beef bouillon (original recipe X3) to be slightly over powering--changing the flavor of the lamb too much for my taste.  The yellow onions worked well as suggested by another reviewer.  I'd probably use half as much bouillon next time to strenghten the lamb flavor a bit or add more water which I did with one baking pan.  Also, might try something to sweeten the sauce more like adding more brown sugar.  Merot wine goes great with this dish if you maintain the lamb flavor, so strong recommendation on this wine combination.

I must have done something wrong when making this I think because the patties were too runny and took over 30mins in the oven to cook through properly. So anyway, accepting that the error is likely mine, I'm only rating this on flavour and direction - not on how they looked when they turned out and how long they took to cook, etc. Taste-wise these were pretty nice although the flavours were quite subtle. I felt the tzatziki overpowered the latkes a bit and they probably would have been perfectly nice on their own or just with some mint yogurt. I enjoyed the latkes though and the tzatziki was fairly good, although I'm not accustomed to having onion/shallots in it. The addition of the red wine vinegar was nice, but lack of draining of the cucumber meant the tzatziki went watery very quickly. This could be easily fixed by 20-30mins draining in a seive with some salt sprinkled on top. Although the whole recipe was easy to make the directions weren't wonderful in places - I presumed that the zucchini and cucumber needed to be shredded and that the shallots needed chopping as finely as I could be bothered (because of the tzatziki). I didn't understand the oven temperature either: 176F is cold and 450F is practically off the scale so I presume there's a typo in the first direction. In the end I baked at 200c. Also, the cooking instructions seem a little unnecessary in places - frying AND baking seems a bit long winded when I'm sure one or t'other option would have worked fine on its own, but perhaps ther are reasons for this that I am unaware of. Reading this back it sounds like I'm really slating the recipe, but if you bypass a few simple bits and pieces this is a good recipe.

I have had this recipe for 40 years and refused to pass it out because it was already requested for me to bring it to work pot lucks.  when I handed out the recipe and taught people how to make it, everyone else started bringing it to pot lucks and I was left wondering what to bring.  I will tell you though, the recipe does need a few alterations to make it easy to make as well as a few clarifications for those who have never seen it made.  Also, this really is best made with a can of Oregon Boysenberries, but they are sometimes difficult to find.  You can also use other canned fruit, but boysenberries are still the BEST.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes to the recipe include changing the marshmallows to one full package of the Kraft marshmallows (about 10 ozs or so).  Also, double the milk (to 1 cup).  Then melt the marshmallows with the milk.  I prefer to cool the marshmallows so they are just slightly cooler than room temperature, so don&#039;t leave in the refrigerator for a long time.  Also double the whipped cream to 1 pint as this will be added to the marshmallow mixture that was doubled.&lt;br/&gt;The instructions say to add the whipped cream to the marshmallow mix, but in actuality when the marshmallow mixture is slightly cooled, you will separately put the whipped cream in a bowl and whip it until it is just getting slightly peaked.  then you add the marshmallow mixture to finish whipping it until you get good peaks.&lt;br/&gt;I don&#039;t use the nut meats at all.&lt;br/&gt;The boysenberries should also be cooked ahead of time.  Put the boysenberries, along with the sugar and lemon juice in a pan and bring to a boil.  The cornstarch called for never seems to be enough for me, but put some cornstarch in a bowl and add a bit of water to make it liquid and use it in the boysenberries like making a gravy.  this is what thickens it.  When it is thickened. put it in the refrigerator and this does need to cool all the way or it could melt your marshmallow mixture later.&lt;br/&gt;You will layer this in a 9x9 baking dish.  graham cracker base, half the marshmallow mixture (maybe 1/2 &quot; thick), the entire boysenberry mix, the other half of the marshmallow mixture, and then sprinkle the remaining graham crackers on top.&lt;br/&gt;Excellent stuff!"},{"name":"cucumber radish slaw","steps":"peel the cucumbers , halve lengthwise and scrape out the seeds', 'thinly slice the cucumbers on the diagonal', 'combine the cucumbers and radishes in a colander', 'toss together with the sea salt', 'top the vegetables with a plate that will fit inside the colander and weight the plate with a heavy item to help the veggies drain', 'drain the vegetables in the sink for about 20 minutes , squeeze them between paper towels to dry , then transfer to a bowl', 'combine the red onion , cider vinegar , olive oil and sugar', 'pour over the cucumber and radishes', 'toss to combine', 'season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and serve immediately'","description":"i love to serve this dish when we cook on the grill in the summertime.  it's so  refreshing on hot days.  this was printed in a cookbooklet that i received in one of our swaps.","ingredients":"english cucumbers', 'radish', 'sea salt', 'red onions', 'cider vinegar', 'olive oil', 'sugar', 'salt & freshly ground black pepper'","review":"Such a lovely simple sauce, I made it then stirred in leftover spaghetti from the night before and served with chicken tenders and a stir fry of veggies from the garden.
