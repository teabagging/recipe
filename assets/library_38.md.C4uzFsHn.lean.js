I adore pumpkin and couldn't wait to make this recipe by one of my team mates during ZWT3.  I made a few slight substitutions just to lighten the ingredients up a bit.  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and used 1/4 cup of the brown sugar Splenda blend and 1/4 cup of honey...it wasn't quite sweet enough so I then added about a tablespoon of regular Splenda.  I used the spices and walnuts as suggested (LOVED BOTH the cinnamon & nutmeg!!!) and used whole wheat flour... I like the nutty flavor that lends with pumpkin.  Midwest Maven had mentioned this as being a great Thanksgiving recipe, so with that in mind I reached for dried cranberries instead of raisins (I love that mixed with pumpkin and nuts) and added a very generous 1/2 cup.  My cake baked in approx. 50 minutes and when it cooled I faked the icing a bit...the recipe sounds great but I am just not a big fan of that type of icing ...so I used MM's idea as a guide and mixed 3/4 cup of powdered sugar with a tablespoon of melted butter  - added vanilla, some more cinnamon and nutmeg to taste (*I like it spicy!!!) and the hot H2O to create a frosting like texture...then I sort of spotted it on the cake surface and sprinkled a dusting of ground nuts over the top before cutting it into bars.  They came out so good and were fabulous both freshly out of the oven as well as chilled the next day.

The original sauce got it&#039;s consistency from the flour and butter roux, which was cooked to perfection until it was golden and nutty smelling. This also helped keep it from breaking in the steam table. The roux was the key to this sauce. This also gave the sauce it&#039;s signature look, with a slight sheen on the top from the pork fat.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highlight of the green sauce was an elevated cumin taste, and a cayenne pepper finish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the kitchens staffs favorite&#039;s -  a plate of french fries topped with Diablo sauce, shredded pepper jack cheese, ripe olives, green onions, jalapeno&#039;s, and a little sour cream. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;ve got the recipes for their famous Chili Con Queso, and Guacamole, that I will post up when I get time."},{"name":"rhubarb pie ii","steps":"combine all ingredients except butter or margarine', 'line a 9 pie plate with orange pastry', 'fill with rhubarb mixture and dot with the butter or margarine', 'top with lattice crust', 'bake at 400 degrees 40 to 50 minutes', 'serve warm with vanilla ice cream'","description":"","ingredients":"rhubarb', 'flour', 'sugar', 'salt', 'orange rind', 'butter'","review":"I just tried this, it is great!

I will never buy corned beef at the store again!! I got a beef brisket that was close to 4 1/2 pounds.(If you can't find a brisket in your store, ask the butcher if they have any.)  It was too big to fit in my stock pot for brining in one piece so I cut it in half. I put both pieces in the stockpot and added the brining ingredients. I then put a plate on top of the meat to weigh it down.(as directed) I started it on Monday (March 15th.) I brined it for 5 days!! On Saturday(5 days later)I took one piece of the meat out of the brine solution and set it aside. I put the other one in a smaller pot, covered it with the brine solution, returned it to the fridge and continued brining it. My crockpot was too small for both pieces.  \\n    I  took the piece of meat  I had set aside and  rinsed it really well to get the brine solution off of it.  This makes the meat less salty when you cook it. I then put it in my crockpot and followed the rest of the directions in the recipe. I cooked it for about 8-9 hours. I put the cabbage in during the last 20 or so minutes of cooking time. It absorbed the flavors in the meat juices. The meat was VERY tender and VERY tasty!!!\\n  I cooked the other one today (Monday) on the top of my stove, following the recipe directions. It was very good too. I couldn't tell any difference in flavors by brining it longer. I think I added too much water to the pot when I cooked it   today. Next time I make this, I will add less water to cook it in. I might be able to tell a difference then.  \\n  Thanks Evelyn for an excellent recipe.

We have NO taste buds left - that is JUST how spicy we like our food.  I halved the recipe (was cooking for three tonight, a total blessing - rather than the usual 6-7). No problem, no waste of ingredients - which was a pleasant surprise.  I used HOT Hungarian paprika, as well as some ground cayenne pepper, fresh parsley (didn't have the dried), added a little dried basil to the mix.  I also used Lawry's Seasoned Salt in lieu of regular salt.  I also added a dash of garlic powder.  The chicken came out great, I had pre-sliced chicken tenders and served over a bed of angel hair pasta tossed with a garlic/olive oil mix.  I took heed of one reviewer who said the chicken stuck to the foil, so I sprayed a super light coating of Pam on the foil before baking...still stuck, but not that bad, certainly didn't effect the taste whatsoever.  It was a little greasy, but that may have been my fault in not shaking off enough of the butter, however, this was easily solved by placing the chicken on paper towels to blot dry.  This is a keeper and I will add it to my recipe book, I thank you for sharing!  This would be great at room temp served over a lovely green salad.

Prior to roasting the stuffed chicken, I made a thin paste from olive oil and paprika, then using all of this paste, painted the entire chicken and put it into a very hot oven (400) for 20 minutes.  This browned the skin; I then covered the chicken with a foil tent,turned down the oven and let it do its thing for 2 hours.  I will post this recipe and let you know when it is accepted and posted.

I made this cake today for a little girl, Abi. It is her ninth birthday today and I had promised her a chocolate cake made from scratch by me and decorated with a Barbie doll picture. In this cake, I substituted the vanilla essence with 1 tsp. of orange essence and 1 tsp. of banana essence. As for the buttermilk, I made that at home by adding the juice of 1 lemon to a little less than 1 1/2 cups of milk. Then, I allowed this to sit for 10 minutes before using in the recipe. I set to baking this and it took close to 45 minutes to bake. Then, I gave it another 1 1/2 hours to cool and after that I made the frosting for this cake. This is the best chocolate frosting recipe I have ever come across. You ruined my diet with this one - I licked the bowl clean!! I used just 2 cups of powdered sugar for this and it was a little more sweet even then, but this was just ooh la la icing! I swear, if I didn't have this weight gain problem, I wouldn't mind spreading this on bread and having this for breakfast everyday:) This is so yummy! I also used 3 tbsps. of regular fresh milk for the icing to give it that spreadable consistency. Since I did not have whipping cream on hand, I used Nestle cream instead and it worked very well here. After putting this frosting on the cake nicely, I put an edible Barbie cake decoration picture in the center of the cake. All around the base of the cake, I put Smarties{those are colourful chocolate gems}. On the space that remained on the cake{i.e., all around the Barbie picture}, I used my icing bag and nozzle and wrote HAPPY BIRTHDAY ABI. Abi is going to freak on this! I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am with the incrediblity of this cake!  I'm not guessing, but I am quite sure that this is the cake I will be making for many birthdays to come. This is sinfully lusciously yummylicious if that is even close to what I mean:) Thank you a zillion and one times for posting this recipe. You have made her day and mine too.

It was good to have the reminder about the rum, because it was a while since Id used rum in cooking.  I also added some orange zest and about 2 teaspoons of orange juice when I combined the rum and the sugar, because I know that orange flavourings blend well with rum.

I amended the recipe for light, fluffy pancakes which won't leave you missing the 'real' pancake experience. Here's how: \\n\\nMix everything BUT 3 eggs white in a small food processor. (Can use a blender, but the mix is too thick and doesn't blend well. If you use a blender, add about 1/4 cup 1% or skim milk to loosen it.) Add a packet of Splenda to sweeten the mix. Put the oatmeal mixture into a mixing bowl. \\n\\nBeat the remaining 3 egg whites to soft peaks, add a packet of Splenda, then beat just until the whites firm up to hard peaks. Take 1/4 to 1/3 of the beaten whites and mix it into the oatmeal mixture to loosen it. (Adding it all will deflate the whites.) Then gently fold in the remaining beaten egg whites. Cook as usual, and you have delicious, light, airy pancakes without the carbs! \\n\\nFor a 'syrup', I put fresh or frozen fruit (Phase 2-friendly) into a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Sprinkle on one packet of Splenda and heat so it releases juices, usually mashing the fruit a bit to extract more. Heat until the juices thicken and keep warm until pancakes are done. \\n\\nFor an added touch of richness, I'll add a small dollop of butter to melt into the fruit at the end. And it's easy to play with this 'syrup'. With blueberries, add some grated lemon peel. With peaches, add a little orange peel.
