It costs a lot of money in fuel to turn a moose skewer by tractor for 9 straight days! Which, by the way should be noted as an estimate... We calculated (too late): an 800 lb moose @ 10 minutes per pound = 8000 minutes into 60 minutes = 133.33 hours into 24 hours a day = 5.5 days.\\nOur moose turned out very dry.\\nAnother note: gut and bleed the moose properly. We made the mistake of trying to clean out the entrails by reaching in through the anus. My wife's arms were just not long enough to reach all the way in... Needless to say I had to resort to other means. A spreader, a hoe and a small rake finally worked. BTW, we also forgot to hose the inside down and drain it before cooking.\\nWe thought it a good idea at this point to stuff the body cavity with seasonings and vegetables. We placed all of our harvested onions, celery, carrots, and potatoes inside the moose (next time we'll save some in case things do not turn out).\\nIn the end we still ate the whole moose as we had placed our winter provisions into this dish and moose season doesn't open again 'til next year.\\nWe froze the leftovers."},{"name":"proper yorkshire pudding","steps":"put all ingredients in a large bowl and beat very thoroughly with electric whisk until a fairly thin batter is made', 'put the meat fat or any other oil or fat you like to use , into patty tins', 'heat in a very hot oven until it smokes', 'pour in the batter , return to the very hot oven and bake for approximately 12 to 15 minutes- until well risen', 'a proper yorkshire pudding has a top and a bottom and no middle !', 'it can be served the traditional way , with gravy before the main meal , or after the meal with syrup', 'time to make approx 20- 25 minutes', 'large yorkshires are delicious served filled with meat& gravy and veg , or just sausages and a rich onion gravy'","description":"traditional starter, served with roast beef, but in yorkshire it is served with all roast meats on a sunday.the recipe is sufficient to make 12 puddings in patty tins, or two large ones using 7 cake tins. it has come down my family for generations - being a yorkshire woman i have always found it very successful.

The cognac adds such a delicate flavor and goes well together with shrimp and pasta. I love the lemon zest in this recipe, which gave such a nice fruity note. I added also some feta cheese and I strongly suggest to do so, because the creamy texture of the cheese is a great combination with the shrimp. The tagliatelle mixed with the parsley are looking great and giving the pasta a fresh and herb background, wonderful. This is an easy and fast to make dish. And a keeper in my cookbooks. \\n\\nA further comment: If you like to burn the alcohol, I would suggest to do it at the table, because of the effect.

I did not add the Swiss cheese at the end; I honestly think it would be a little too decadent with that addition!  Maybe next time.  This dish was adored by all.

We have a simple, no-turn method of cooking a fillet of salmon (with skin on one side) on a gas grill. Take a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil that is a little larger than your fillet. I usually roll all four sides of the foil up a turn or two to create an edge, it prevents any juices from flowing off. Lay the salmon skin side down on the foil. Season the top of the fillet. For this recipe I did not season the salmon with olive oil, salt and pepper. I simply brushed it with the soy sauce/honey glaze just before cooking. Preheat a gas grill and set temperature at medium high. Place the foil with salmon fillet directly on the grill grates. The foil allows the salmon to cook with indirect heat. No need to turn the salmon while it cooks! When the salmon is done, take a large serving spatula (the kind you flip pancakes with) and slide it gently along the bottom of the fillet. The flesh seperates easily from the skin, which now sticks firmly to the foil. Thanks for posting this delicious dish!

Almost every one stuck, but more than that - I followed the directions about cooking until the spring back - they never did. I think because of the seperated eggs they had an airier texture then you usually get with madeleines so instead of spring they just dented.  Then when cooked longer a touch broke through. They were dry not fudgy at all. The one in the tins I baked for 13 mins - I should have pulled them our when I first checked at 11, but was looking for the spring. I cooked 4 in little tart tins that were deeper and pulled them out sooner, they were a little moister but not much, they reminded me of a dry cake brownie, but at least the flavor was good.

Replaced 2 egg substitute with one whole banana mashed with 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder + 1/2 cup of applesauce with 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda (this was equal to 2 eggs). The added baking soda was in addition to the baking soda called for in the recipe, which again I doubled. Also added about 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice to the bread mix.  The glaze is a must, continue to add powder sugar until you reach the thickness you desire.

I used Swiss Gruyere that I'd found at a good price (stores well, too), and an 8 oz. can of (salt-free) tomato sauce because other reviewers mentioned a tendency towards a dry, crumbly texture. I didn't have an onion in the house so I hydrated some flakes I happened to have and I used store-bought chopped garlic in olive oil instead of the powder.

He said he would give it four stars (which I'm guessing really means five stars but he just won't admit it.)  :)  I took Alydes advice and subbed in half chili sauce which gave it a little kick.  A must try.  I discovered midway through I only had fat free cheddar cheese and was worried, but I couldn't taste a bit of difference.  I even forgot to cover the pan while the lentils cooked and ended up having to nuke them and it still turned out fabulous.

Once it was all mixed up, it looked like A LOT and as I started filling a loaf pan, thought, no wonder some reviewers say it is mushy in the middle. So I broke up the mix into two loaf pans for 2 very shallow loaves. I added a bit of tomato sauce/BBQ sauce on top before cooking, covered with foil.

That can affect your recipe. Are you using quick-cooking oats? That's another factor that's really important with this. The last solve I know of is to use rice (parboil it) instead of oats to absorb some of that excess moisture you are having trouble with. Cooking for longer results in the same problem we had with our mom's meatloaves as kids: it'll dry out. This is a REALLY great recipe and you deserve to have it come out the way that many of the other readers are experiencing it. I'm not sure what the final 'solve' will be for you, but I can honestly say that as an ex-chef, this is an example of food magic that I've always striven to achieve. Give it another try and let us know what worked for you-it'll help us all out.

I modified the recipe a little: instead of the tomato sauce, I made a sauce with ketchup, organic soy sauce, organic molasses, and vegetable broth (to keep it moist). I used tinned lentils, 2 eggs instead of 1, 3 big cloves of garlic, fresh basil, and added a couple of veggie wieners, all of which I blended in the food processor. In the last 10 minutes of baking, I also drizzled some more sauce made with ketchup and honey on top. It was delicious by itself, but an alternative would be to cut down on the sodium in the sauce that goes in the meatloaf, but make a mushroom gravy to serve on the side. The meatloaf cooked evenly in a 9x5 inch loaf pan and is about 1.5 in. high. You could easily double the ingredients and make a full-size loaf (but it is very rich as it is which makes the smaller portions appealing). We had it with a Romaine heart salad and were very happy with it.

I added chopped celery to the mix per comments. I also brushed the top with a mixture of 1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 bbq sauce (and made extra quantity of this sauce to serve on the side). Overall I thought this was very good, but I did feel like the texture of the loaf could use a bit of work. I won't mash the lentils next time (as this - I think- might be responsible for a graininess noticeable in parts of the loaf) but instead add them whole. Because the celery & onion added a bit of texture/crunch to the loaf which helped with texture, next time I think I might also try adding sunflower seeds and/or grated carrots to the mix.

As a lentil-loaf sandwich, this is fantastic! Wheat bread, mayo and a slice of american cheese...yum, yum!

Bake at 350 for 20-30 minutes. Delicious!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Substitutions: mix of red/yellow onion, added carrots (not recommended), pizza sauce instead of plain tomato.<br/><br/>Recommendation: I find lentils come out better (less tough, easier to mash) if you boil them without salt. For dry lentils, boil 1 1/2 to 2 cups water (w/o salt!), add 1 cup dry lentils and bring to boil again. Reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes. The lentils should have absorbed most of the water and will be fairly easy to mash with a spoon.

I've occasionally  added another egg, although I felt guilty about the extra fat. <br/>2.) I've added chopped celery,carrots, mushrooms as suggested by other reviewers. <br/>3.) In addition, and sometimes in place of the cheddar cheese , I added Parmesan cheese.   <br/>4.) Per suggestion of my girlfriend, I use a hand mixer instead of the blender now.

I used fresh garlic instead of powder.<br/><br/>When I boiled the lentils I threw in a low sodium veggie boullion and some onion flakes.  I did not salt the water. <br/><br/> I used 1/4 cup colby jack and a 1/4 cup 50-50 mixture of manchego and parmesan.  I did not put a 3rd 1/4 cup cheese in.

You can tweak the ingredients to be whatever style you are in the mood for (mexican, add taco seasonings, italian, pasta sauce, etc).  As for changes to the basic recipe, I like to take about 1/3 of the cooked lentils and puree them with about 1/2 - 1 cup of vegetable broth in the food processor.  I find that this adds some needed moisture because this loaf can come out dry.  I also add a 2nd egg like others have noted.  I like to add a package of instant oatmeal instead of whole oats because my kids are texture picky.  I use some seasoned bread crumbs as well.  I have made this several times in the past and put nothing but dots of ketchup on top but just made it last night and in addition to the ketchup,  I used the glaze that was offered by another reviewer which is 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, and 1/3 cup of ketchup.  Mix this up beforehand and put it on the top of the loaf during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking.  It thickens up and it really gives a nice tangy taste.  We used the extra as a condiment.  I also left out the cheese this time by mistake actually but found that it was fine without it.  Overall, an excellent basic recipe.  Thank you for sharing it!  A time saving tip is to buy precooked lentils from Trader Joe's - you just have to open the package and start mixing.

I also had to omit the oats because the oats that I have in the pantry aren&#039;t reliably gluten free.  Here is what I did instead: I soaked 2 tablespoons of chia seed to replace the egg.  Soaked chia seed get gummy like the consistency of egg whites after soaking in water.  Also, I added ground flax seed and cooked quinoa in place of the oats.  I added extra seasoning because of the omitted cheese.  In addition, I omitted the seasoning salt--I never use it as it is an unhealthy spice choice. I found that the recipe worked well when I made it ahead and allowed it to set in the fridge for a few hours as a make-ahead dish.  It held together better, and the flavors blended better this way.  I also added mushrooms and colored peppers as suggested by other reviewers.  Instead of ketchup or the BBQ sauce that was recommended, I chose to top the loaf with a fresh tomato from the garden.  Simply sliced the tomatoes and placed on the top before baking.  It really looked pretty.  I suppose that I  reworked this recipe a lot, but I had to because of the various food intolerances in our home!"},{"name":"pumpkin and leek soup   no dairy","steps":"halve leeks lengthways and wash them under cold water to remove any dirt or sand', 'thinly slice them', 'will use the white and light green portion for addition to the soup', 'peel and slice onions', 'using a large soup / stock pot add the olive oil the leeks , onions and salt', 'cook , stirring often , for 5 minutes', 'add the minced garlic and cook another 1 minute', 'add all remaining ingredients and boil for approx 25 minutes , or until the pumpkin is tender', 'use a stick blender or food processor to puree the soup', 'reheat', 'optional to add some cooked beans eg cannellini beans , at this stage', 'heat through before serving', 'serve sprinkled with some chopped fresh herbs and a crusty roll or toast', 'store any left-over soup in the fridge and reheat as required', 'this soup keeps and reheats well as it has no dairy added', 'this soup can also be frozen and reheated as required'","description":"a simple vegetable soup made without dairy. leeks are noted for being rich in iron and the garlic/onion are noted for their immune boosting qualities. for some extra protein stir in some beans such as cannellini beans after the soup has been blended and heat through. serve with  some crusty bread, cornbread or a bread roll. an excellent soup for the colder months or for a quick re-heat lunch to take with you to work. i like to use butternut pumpkin but you can use any variety of pumpkin. i use massell brand stock that is gluten free and animal product free (including their chicken stock). shown in my posted photo with gluten free recipe#218469","ingredients":"leeks', 'onions', 'salt', 'olive oil', 'minced garlic cloves', 'butternut pumpkin', 'chicken stock', 'water', 'cracked black pepper', 'chili powder', 'fresh rosemary'","review":"This really is the best veggie loaf EVER.

Canned soup is great in a pinch, but if you are able, please try the white sauce first! It makes a world of difference and really gives it the proper flavor. Being a novice chef, I thought there was something more complicated to white sauce than just a roux, so we used canned white sauce I'm afraid - still turned out fabulous, though next time I'll know better and just make it myself!

For our anniversary my husband and I wanted a carrot cake and a cheesecake and came across this recipe, it was very good, especially the next day. Although we used Alton Brown's cream cheese recipe, because my husband didn't want the pineapple icing, and his only complaint was that the icing tasted too much like the cheesecake and he would have liked something with a different taste! We only made half the recipe so we wouldn't eat the whole thing ourselves and we made it in a silicone bread pan It baked it for 25 minutes and we shut the oven off while the cheesecake center still slightly wobbled and left it for 4 hours so the cheesecake wouldn't overbake.

So for our Pioneer Girls Bake-Off competition I dared to whip it up and it's actually much easier than it appears!  My only problem was that after I refrigerated it for a day then tried to transfer it to a cake plate, I noticed the whole middle wasn't cooked!  So I ended up making a 2nd one (oh darn, I had to eat the first myself!) and this time tweaked the recipe a bit:\\n1) I added only about 1 TBSP of chopped pineapple, as I thought that maybe it was too wet.\\n2) After baking for 60 minutes, I reduced the temperature to 300 and added approx. 20 minutes of baking time (I have an electric oven and I certainly didn't want to have a runny middle again!)\\n3) I made my own glaze of 3 oz. cream cheese, 1 1/2 c. powdered sugar, a dash of milk and just a bit of vanilla.  Then I topped it with chopped walnuts.\\n\\nAlso to note-- this cheesecake is not supposed to have a crust, as the carrot cake actually serves in that function so don't worry that it has no graham crackers.  And alone the cheesecake is quite good, not too sweet and very mild; but with the glaze... whoa watch out for sweetness!  Everyone at the contest was wowed by the idea of it and although I'm not an expert cook and haven't even made a cheesecake in maybe 10 years, I still won first place!  The ingredients speak for themselves-- who can resist cake and cheese?!?"},{"name":"pumpkin custard pie","steps":"preheat oven to 350 f', 'mix all the ingredients together', 'pour into 9 inch non-stick pan', 'bake until set , about 60 minutes'","description":"a classic vegan pumpkin pie, perfect for thanksgiving!","ingredients":"sugar', 'cornstarch', 'canned pumpkin', 'soymilk', 'cinnamon', 'ginger', 'clove', 'nutmeg', 'salt'","review":"This was a pleasure to make!
