I was pretty sure this was going to be really good or really bad and fortunately it was the former!  I don't think I've ever had a piccata before, but I love it with the cannellini beans!  I did omit the capers since I didn't have any (like EdsGirlAngie I think they're gross) and followed ReLani's lead and used chicken broth.  Really a tasty and filling meal!  I used whole wheat pastry flour for the flour actually and served over whole wheat pasta... we almost strictly eat whole grains, but I just wanted to mention that whole wheat flour works fine for the roux and the flavors of this are strong enough that they can take on a hearty whole wheat pasta.  I did add a splash of cream to the mix, because I felt it was wanting a bit of richness and we served with plenty of fresh parmesean.  Really terrific dinner.  In all honesty, considering the amount of 'sauce' I have left in my pot, I think I might have been able to get up to 6 servings out of this!  Very quick and easy supper, especially with the canned beans.  Oh!  I also only used 4 Tbs lemon juice, to taste, but I think my juice is tarter than some.

It is all beige, except for the capers (which I love even though I'm not usually a big fan of anything brined or pickled). You've got beige beans in a gooey sauce over beige pasta. It doesn't taste beige, though; it tastes sunny from the lemons and capers, but has a starchy, warming, comforting texture. I was wondering how this would work, because I do make snapper or chicken piccata fairly often, which involve fillets of things, rather than the small individual beans. This does indeed have a different texture despite the similar ingredients; with a filet of something you flour and brown it and the flour mostly sticks to it. It would be hard to get flour to stick to beans, so this (as I cooked it) had a thicker sauce and a slightly different taste because the flour was not browned.  Overall, this had a nice comforting flavor and makes a healthy alternative to most starchy casseroles."},{"name":"aunt liz s almond broccoli casserole","steps":"pre-stream broccoli for about 5 minutes', 'saute onions and garlic in butter', 'add soup , cheese whiz and mushrooms to sauteed onion mixture', 'put broccoli into a greased casserole dish and pour sauce over it', 'sprinkle the almonds over this and then sprinkle the croutons on top', 'bake at 350 degf for 30 minutes'","description":"my aunt is a great cook and this is one of her recipes. we all enjoy her cooking and baking.","ingredients":"broccoli', 'garlic', 'onion', 'butter', 'cream of mushroom soup', 'cheese whiz', 'mushrooms', 'slivered almonds', 'crouton'","review":"Very, very delicious, Angie.

Then it was time to add the flour and follow the rest of the steps.  I wanted to add some color and also didn't want to have to fix a salad or other side, so after the sauce thickened, I add two big handfuls of freash spinach, covered the pan and let that sit for about 5-6 minutes until the spinach wilted.  I'd thought about serving with rice because beans and rice is a combo I'm more familiar with, but I'm glad I stuck with noodles because the sauce really clung to the pasta well.  \\nTwo things I would do different next time is use more beans and less lemon juice.

I took the good advice of Mary and thickened up the bit of sauce that there is after cooking. While the chicken was cooking after being turned, I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to 3 tsp of cool water, mixed and let it sit.  When the chicken was done, I  put the cooked breasts on a plate and added a thin slice of blue cheese to each piece and covered.  Then I set the pan on the stove top and added about a half cup or so of dry white wine (pinot grigio)and brought that to a boil which loosened up the flavourful bits on the bottom of the pan.  Then I gave the cornstarch mixture a stir and added it stirring constantly until it thickened up - about one minute.  Created a very tasty reduction sauce which I spooned over the chicken breasts before serving.  You could use chicken stock instead of the wine to make the reduction sauce.  Next time I think I'll use a mixture of half a cup of wine and half a cup of chicken stock.  Also, next time I'll only add extra slices of the blue cheese to those that have had blue cheese before and not to the rest.  It's definitely an acquired taste.  I served this with a salad of baby greens and fresh lightly steamed asparagus with Lemon Dijon Salad Dressing #213686 lightly spooned over both.
