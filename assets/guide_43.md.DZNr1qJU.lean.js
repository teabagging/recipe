When I re-opened it after adding the veggies, I used the towel to open it and that worked perfectly.  All of you first timers, that steam is SERIOUS!<br/><br/>Aside from that, the recipe was great.  I had bought a pre-packaged corned beef that was seasoned and had the spice packet.  So I added some dehydrated sliced garlic and bay leaves to that and it was great.  I even forgot to skim the broth and it was still great.  I was expecting the broth to be gross because I didn't skim, but it wasn't.  It looked great.<br/>I couldn't believe the potatoes were fully cooked after just 6 minutes. <br/>I depressurized after the veggies and left everything in the pressure cooker for about 90 minutes until dinner time and the veggies got a bit more done than I like--probably because I left them in.

I took a lot of liberties with it, but I think they helped the final result. The texture of the meat and beans was amazing.  Th meat was fall apart tender, while still retaining a nice porky flavor. The beans were creamy, velvety, and delicious.  Even my 4 year old niece liked this dish!   So my changes- first, I wanted to make this same day instead of OAMC. So I took the salt, fennel seed, garlic, and sage, and made a paste in a morter and pestle, which I spread over the meat and let sit for about 20 minutes, to approximate the marinating that this would get while thawing according to the original recipe.  Then, I seared the roast, and deglazed the pan with vermouth, which I substituted for part of the water called for.  For the rest of the water, I substituted vegetable broth for additional flavor.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of dried summer savory, since it has such an affinity with beans.  I'm not sure whether it helped, but I want to be true to what I did.  The last change I made was cooking time- 8 hours on high just seemed too long to me.  I started on high, but after 3 hours, my crock pot was boiling, so I turned it to low for the remaining 5 hours.  I loved the result.  This is a definite make again, hopefully soon!

I also added rice noodles to give it more substance, esp for my kids.  I can't see making it w/o either next time.  The only other thing I'd change for next time is leaving the lemongrass longer to make it easier to remove before eating.  It was a bit of a pain to remove them individually from our bowls.

gets his real pepperoni and real cheese on his pizza and i get my substitutions, but this time, i couldn't afford it, nor could i afford ordering out, so i just made them partly homemade and he said he really liked them.  the first variation is made with plain english muffins.  the second is made with extra sourdough bread.  we've actually already had the muffin pizzas twice this week, and i had the second variation last night because we were out of muffins.  i used extra sourdough bread because it needed to be used up before it went bad, but regular sourdough bread should work just as well.  french bread should also work just fine, as a variation, but i have only included two.  of course, add any additional toppings you prefer or change the amounts or cooking time to your tastes.  i was just really going for a simple pizza.  mine was pepperoni and pineapple, the bf's was pepperoni only.  edited to add an update to this:  bf and i have been using a baking rack on top of the foil-lined baking sheet, which allows the bottoms to get crispy too.  we have used french bread, english muffins, and sourdough bread very successfully, as well as having successful results using real cheese,

The maple flavor and walnut topping are incredible together--and with only 1/4 teaspoon of butter in each cookie! Like the previous reviewer, I made this recipe using the usual cut-out cookie dough making procedure: 1.) I mixed the dry ingredients together in a bowl; 2.) creamed the butter and sugar together in another bowl--then beat in the remaining wet ingredients; 3.) stirred the dry mixture--a little at a time--into the wet mixture; and 4.) chilled the dough until it was firm. I used whole wheat pastry flour, sodium-free baking powder, and a whole egg. And I nearly doubled the amount of walnuts--and ground them fairly fine (they do stick better that way). This recipe is such a great find...I've been collecting cookie cutters for years, but rarely use them because of the amount of butter in most cut-out cookie dough. I can hardly wait to make these at Christmas!

I also had to adjust the heat on my range to medium, because at low it wasn't getting the strips firm.  After turning up the heat, the tofu strips cooked up perfectly.  I used half brown sugar and half molasses and the full amount of liquid smoke to swirl around the tofu. I bought the yeast flakes at the health food store around the corner, and they are a key ingredient in this recipe.  They really add a bacony-type of flavor and a crispy exterior.  My hubby and son tried these also, at my insistence because they really didn't want to try tofu bacon, but after tasting it they both agreed that it was good and didn't taste like tofu.

Well, guess what?  Ultra pasteurized cream doesn't curdle, it just gets very thick when the vinegar is added.  I stirred and stirred, but when it became clear it wasn't going to produce any curds I continued with the recipe and hoped for the best.  Eureka!  After 24 hours sitting in a coffee filter-lined sieve in the fridge, I actually got a firm product!  It wasn't quite as solid as regular mascarpone (it could probably have stood a few more hours of draining) but it was good enough to make a great tiramisu.  Best yet, one quart really does yield 1 lb., which can cost $10+ in stores.

I was able to purchase all the ingredients except the lecithin, so used the mixture without. I included the mixture in two bread recipes, using white bread flour, but would be hard put to say whether there was a difference or not. Perhaps the effect is more pronounced in heavier breads. I feel it would take more research than I am prepared to do to accurately judge the efficacy of this enhancer. Therefore I am choosing not to assign stars. Learning about the different ingredients of this dough enhancer was quite interesting. As I understand it, the milk and lecithin are emulsifiers, which make the dough finer textured. The gluten combines with the gluten existing in the flour, and adds elasticity, which makes it possible for the dough to rise higher. The ascorbic acid and ginger encourage yeast action. I don't know the purpose of the gelatin and pectin, but assume they work to preserve freshness.

But-I DO like cookies! When I saw this recipe I said to myself, how hard can it be, must try it.\\nAll went well in the beginning albeit that I thought the butter was too hard and softened it in the micro-wave, softened it a bit too long, it was almost all melted. But the dough was easy to mix. I did add 1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger (someone told me oatmeal cookies should be made with a little ginger). It said in the instructions, drop by teaspoon. Well, the dough was a bit stiff for that (must be my fault) so I decided to roll them by hand. Teaspoon measurement, oh no, the cookies would be too small, let's make them about the size of a dessert spoon. Which I did and then flattened them with a fork. Got about twenty cookies. Put them in the oven for eleven minutes and walked away. (everyone tells me you should stay by the oven when baking cookies, did I tell you I am a clutz at this?).\\nAnyway, after eleven minutes they were a bit pale and they were HUGE (little did I realise that cookies spread out, that is the reason for making them so small in the beginning, did I tell you I am a clutz?)\\nDecided to bake them for another four minutes. They were then a little browner and seemed done. Took them out of the oven and wanted to remove them immediately, aargh, they were too soft. Read the instructions once again, oh yes, it said to cool slightly before removing. Did that and now they were easy to handle. \\nAnd now to taste one, what can I say, they were wonderful. Needed lots of second opinions and took them to work. They were gobbled up and could I please make another batch (actually batches) so we can have more than half a cookie each.\\nI was so proud, I had actually made cookies that were NOT hard as a rock, NOT burned, and very very tasty!\\nThanks so much for posting.\\nMade for PAC Spring '08."},{"name":"ihilani s passion fruit iced tea","steps":"place the tea bags in a heat proof pitcher', 'bring a pot of water just to boil and pour over the tea bags', 'cover pitcher and allow to steep 3 minutes', 'once steeping is complete , remove the tea bags and refrigerate for several hours until very cold', 'stir in remaining ingredients and serve over ice'","description":"from gourmet magazine may 1998, this iced tea is served at the ihilani resort and spa in oahu, hawaii. you can substitute frozen passion fruit puree, available at latino markets if you cannot find frozen passion fruit concentrate.","ingredients":"orange pekoe tea bags', 'cold water', 'cranberry juice cocktail', 'frozen passion fruit juice concentrate', 'honey', 'sugar'","review":"what an easy cookie that baked out lovely, I even added in 1/2 cup peanut butter, next time i will add in some mini chocolate chips, thanks for sharing a great recipe MRSJSPANTS!"},{"name":"ihop buttermilk pancakes","steps":"place first 5 ingredients into a bowl , add buttermilk , oil and egg', 'with a spoon mix all ingredients and beat until smooth', 'spray a griddle for frying pan with nonstick spray', 'heat pan or griddle to medium low heat', 'fry pancakes until small bubbles show on top before flipping pancakes', 'if batter is too thick add a little more buttermilk'","description":"i got this recipe years ago from copykat creations website. these are the only pancakes made in my house. they are fabulous. note: i do use the extra buttermilk for a thinner batter. these are light and fluffy.","ingredients":"flour', 'baking powder', 'sugar', 'salt', 'baking soda', 'vegetable oil', 'egg', 'buttermilk'","review":"I used some leftover chicken here and mixed it with the satay marinade posted here.

One final suggestion: I always feel like more is better so I started juicing more than 1/4 cup of lime juice and remembered what I had read in what another reviewer had mentioned that they did 1/3 and regretted it.  It is true, as the sauce is very thin so don't over do it on the lime juice.  Will definitely do again.
