Great recipe! Simple, easy to follow, and perfect results. I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 flour and vegan butter to make it gluten-free and non-dairy...muffins turned out moist, fluffy, and tender. Oh, I also added a pinch of nutmeg to the batter and baked at a slightly lower temperature (about 355 degrees for the 18-20 minutes) because my oven was already hot from two batches of cookies. Finally, I topped muffins with glaze made with coconut oil, powdered sugar, non-dairy milk, and salt to taste.

I used golden flax seeds, so mine were lovely brown balls.  Next time I think I might give the carob a shot.  Honey-sweet, lightly crunchy, rich but healthy-tasting at the same time.

I noticed some people were having trouble getting the balls to hold together. I think the problem might be that the directions on amount of flax used is a little confusing. When I put 1/2 c. of flax seed in my VitaMix I noticed that after I ground it the amount doubled in bulk (ie: the 1/2 c. flax seed was now 1 c.). So, I measured 1/2 c. flax seed AFTER it had been ground. Then I ground my sesame and  sunflower seeds as the recipe states. Since my carob was lumpy & hard (must've gotten damp at some point) and my raw coconut was chunky I ended up putting everything back in the VitaMix for one last whirl. I emptied all this into a bowl and added the honey and mixed with a mixing spoon. Everything stuck together nicely.

Thank you for an easy recipe that was a big hit with my family tonight.  We had 'breakfast for supper' and these were perfect.  (I like mine with grape jelly!)  Anyway, I  used a pastry blender instead of a food processor and they were still PERFECTION!   Also, my baking powder did have aluminum sulfate in it.  I used it anyway and it worked out fine.  I'd never noticed that ingredient in baking powder before and wondered what difference it would make without it in this recipe.  (?) Tomorrow I plan to find a different baking powder without the aluminum, then make some of these and put them in the freezer as you suggested.  How nice that will be to just pop them in the oven, but making them on the spot is absolutely no problem anyway!

I added a couple of teaspoons of sugar as I like the subtle richness it adds to biscuits.  I was too lazy to cut in the butter myself, or to haul out the processor, so I tried using my small countertop electric chopper.  Perfect results.  Also, I used buttermilk powder, but instead of mixing the powder with the dry ingredients and using water as ususally recommended, I mixed it with the water and used the resulting buttermilk since I didn't want to overmix and didn't want to take a chance the powder wouldn't be evenly distributed.  Again, perfect results, and lots of pride, as they brought me many kudos. Highly recommended, and my biscuit recipe of choice from here on in.

I followed directions exactly, and for the first time making biscuits, I used my food processor to make the dough, as recommended. Quick, easy and voila.....the best biscuits I've ever made.  I  recommend that you pat the dough out to less than an inch if you are planning on making sausage/egg breakfast biscuits, as these babies really cook up huge and are hard to handle as a sandwich.

Actually any biscuit at all.  I usually have bought bisquick or canned or frozen.  Wanted to try these myself.  Things are getting to the point where its cheaper to make things homemade.  This was so easy to follow.  They will come out every time if you follow the directions and take them literal.  I literally barely touched the dough when kneading it out.  The less you touch it the better it is.  I don't have a food processor so I used a blender.  Worked perfectly!  I even used my hands to make sure the butter got worked in.  Also, make sure your using exact measurements.  If things seem dry to you then you used too much of something.  I didn't use a whole teaspoon of salt.  I used probably 3/4 teaspoon.  I thought 1 whole teaspoon was a little much.  It's also good to use unsalted butter.  Having it cold is ideal!  When you pour in the buttermilk you just use a spoon to make sure its all incorporated.  Its ok if there are lumps.  I wouldn't use a whisk because you might accidentally over mix.  Make sure you do use plenty of extra flour for the surface and your hands.  The dough will be pretty wet and you will need it.  After folding it over 5 times you just pat it to the 1/2 thickness.  I used a small glass to make the shapes since I dont have biscuit cutters.  I didn't knead or reshape the dough that was left over because they would be tougher than the first.  I just tossed it.  I used most of it though.  This is a great recipe and I will be adding to my recipe cookbook and I will be making these again.

However I didn't have real butter so I used stick margarine instead. Processed all, was still a lil dry so added a lil more buttermilk, processed til the dough was 'wet looking' as it says in the directions. Next out of processor onto a flour covered counter top, only moved the dough around enough to cover it in flour, then patted it down and cut out the biscuits. For tall biscuits I placed them together, sides touching on the cookie sheet. Baked as instructed except we live in the mountains at 4016 elevation so took mine about 18 minutes to 'brown'. When done I patted margarine over all the tops, this gives extra flavor and keeps the tops reasonably soft.

I also very much agree with the reviewer who suggested regular salt over kosher salt.  I did not use a rolling pin, but did knead genlty with my hand after turning the dough out onto the board and I cut with them glass jar.
