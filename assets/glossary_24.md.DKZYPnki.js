Tender on the inside and slightly crispy with a pleasant chewiness on the outside...delicious!  I'd never seen a 1/3 tsp. measurement in a recipe before but since I had about a pound and a half of pork shoulder I just upped it to a 1/2 tsp. and used Mexican oregano which I think really contributed to the flavorful sauce.  I browned the meat in batches, then removed from the pot and added about 1/3 cup of orange juice (couldn't get Mojo Criollo in my neck of the woods).  The juice boiled up beautifully and thickened a bit and I added the meat back to the pot and proceeded with the recipe.  Also, after shredding the meat and putting it in a single layer to the sheet pan, I dribbled some of the excellent sauce over it before broiling....just to make sure it didn't dry out and also to keep in some of the excellent flavor in that sauce.  We ate this on flour tortillas with fresh salsa, a bit of guacamole and sour cream.  Really loved them, they'll be made again in my house.

There is one thing that I will do differently next time a after baking, I will invert the pan onto a platter and then ice the rolls.  I think it would be better to put the cream cheese frosting on top of the caramel instead of having the caramel at the bottom and frosting on top.  I really enjoyed making (and eating!) these.

You've got a real nice flavor combination here.  The zucchini was a nice addition & being able to cook it with the chicken & still end up eating a light dinner (not like a stew) was a real treat.

I sprinkled all the dry seasonings on the chicken, then put the chicken into the pan.  To the pan I added the fresh squeezed lemon juice.

This is seriously one of my favorites!  I am relatively new to recipe zaar but not new to cooking.

I have played with some of the ingredients - made it spicier - more cayenne, red pepper, even diced jalapenos.  I always use the 2% milk that I generally have on hand, but there have been times I have used 1/2 & 1/2 or full fat milk milk if I had it - but frankly I can't say I really noticed a difference (I believe the milk might just serve a moisture purpose).  Also I generally sub any sort  of cheese I may have on hand for the cheddar or mozz but definitely stick with parm (just a pref to parm in general).  Also I have increased the eggs to 4 (even 5) to make it more of b-fast thing - but if you plan on eating in the am - just be wary of your garlic and onion amts.

I had a problem as did a previous reviewer with the amount of water added to the rice. I ended up adding close to six cups of water( total, with the required three). I was on the lookout for a possible problem with the amount of water because of the previous reviews, so I was able to salvage the meal, and add water before it ruined the rice. \\n   Next time I will add way more water, double the tomato paste and maybe sub some chicken broth for the water. This is a five star recipe,the flavors are wonderful! I can't wait to try it again. The meat came out fork tender, the house smells amazing,and the nuts on top really finished off the flavor.

Brookster is actually the name given to it by Williams-Sonoma for a kit that WS sells in their store, which includes all of the ingredients.  WS sells a muffin-looking pan that has bigger diameter wells to cook this particular recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;before you begin, note that this recipe, as written actually takes much longer than 38 minutes because as written, it directs you to refrigerate the dough for 1 hour for the chocolate chip dough and 3 hours for the brownie dough once you&#039;ve placed the dough in the pan.  I followed these directions as far as refrigeration was prescribed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I didn&#039;t want to buy a new pan.  I could have used my ceramic ramekins, which are roughly 3-4&quot; for the diameter of the brim, and slightly narrower on the bases of the ramekins; but it would take longer to do bake all of the dough.  instead, I used standard muffin pans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing I would have to refrigerate the chocolate chip dough, and based on a tip I saw somewhere else for similar recipes, I made the chocolate chip dough into 3 long logs and wrapped them in waxed paper, lying them flat in the frig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;brownie batter:  I still greased my &quot;non stick&quot; muffin tins, and i&#039;m glad I did, because the brownie dough will stick to the pan.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used a mini cookie scoop, which is roughly a little bigger than a tablespoon, to scoop the brownie batter into the prepared muffin tins.  in this recipe, that was enough to cover the bottoms of 27 muffin wells.  that was 2, 12 muffin tins and 3 from a 6 muffin tin, if that makes sense.  wrapped saran wrap around them and threw them into the frig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;when the chocolate chip cookie dough was ready, I cut them into equal sized chunks using a steak knife.  having it in a log allows you to plan out the dough for each of the 27 muffin wells.  I fashioned each chunk into small flat discs with my clean bare hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have a thermometer in my oven - check to make sure the oven is at 425 degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I set the timer for the lower end of the bake time range, at 20 min.  they came out slightly darker on the bottom, so for the next round, I set it for 18 min, which was better.  your oven may vary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;they came out cake-like instead of harder like a cookie, the reason for a 4-star. although they were delicious, I was expecting something more cookie-like.  next time, I think i&#039;ll try to use a brownie cookie for the bottom recipe and mold them into slighter larger diameter discs, use this recipe&#039;s chocolate chip cookie dough, and cook them on a cookie sheet so that they can be thinner and harder (cookie-like).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;also, I didn&#039;t have dark chocolate so I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels.  I have a digital kitchen scale, and the 6 oz for the chocolate chip recipe is about 1 cup + maybe 2-3 T. of morsels.  the 5 oz for the brownie batter is about 1 cup of morsels.

It is AWESOME! Thank you so much for posting!! I've made it many times and here are some suggestions...instead of the white and balsamic vinegars, I put in equal amounts of apple cider vinegar. I also increased the tamarind pulp to about 2-3 tsp, which gives it an extra zest. I omit the black pepper and use cayenne instead. When I don't have powdered saffron on hand, I use a little of Goya's Sazon con Azafran. Yummy! I've omitted the cumin several times b/c I didn't have on hand...still turned out wonderfully. I decrease the honey to about a 1/3 c. so it's not too sweet. Also, I found out the hard way that if you let your hand slip on the cashews, it changes the whole consistency and you end up with a thick cream rather than a sauce. Still yummy, but not for dipping.

I'm not giving stars because I changed a few things and so perhaps my opinion will be biased, lol.\\nFirstly, I didn't have cranberries, so subbed raspberries.  Yummy.  They made the most delicious sweet syrup that ran through the whole crisp.  They did make the whole dish just a touch on the sweet side though, so anyone else wanting to sub raspberries, you could cut back on the sugar a touch if you do.\\nSecondly, I made this in a 4 c. pan.  I used half the sugar/flour mixture for the fruit, 2 apples, 1 c. fresh rhubarb, and a 1/2 c. of raspberries.  Because the fruit really cooked down, I think I would use even more next time (but still keep the smaller pan).\\nI made the whole amount of topping, and it still was a bit on the skimpy side for my 4 c. oval dish.  I'm not sure how the same amount could possibly cover a dish double the size.  Oh, and I used white flour, added a pinch of cloves with the cinnamon, and left out the orange rind (you see why I couldn't leave stars with all my tweaking!)\\nAt any rate, it was perfectly cooked in 40 minutes and DH (the rhubarb hater) and I gobbled up 2/3 of the pan with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt...perfection.
