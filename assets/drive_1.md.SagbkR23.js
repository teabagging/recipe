They said the waffles tasted very similar to when we cut up pieces of Italian bread and mop it up in seasoned bread dipping oil. They were on point with the exception that the seasoning was in the waffle! So good! Altho we all thought this was great, I think this would make a better appy. I would cut the waffles into semi thin wedges and place them in the oven to crisp up. As I said, the sauce is thick enough to be used as a dip and I would just add my bacon into the mix.

It was just as delicious and a little less sweet which went well with the turkey dinner. Both times I cooked this the sausage was fully cooked and you could not even tell it was in the bread.
