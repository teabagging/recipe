Soft and messy, with tender cookies and plenty of fluffy filling, just as a good whoopie pie should be. I apologize for the photos, I needed to wrap them so the berries in the middle didn't keep oozing out the sides, and plastic-wrapped food just doesn't photograph well. Oh, and the berries are surprisingly good in these (I used blackberries instead of raspberries because that's what I had on hand). I wasn't sure how I would feel about having them in there, but the little shot of tart juicy berry in the midst of the sweet filling was very nice (a sentiment backed up by my coworkers who tried them). My pies didn't turn out as red velvety as I'd hoped, but that's purely my fault -- I couldn't find my liquid food coloring (the type typically called for in red velvet recipes), so I added a lesser amount of Wilton concentrated gel coloring. The batter looked pretty red after I mixed in three glops of the gel, so I didn't add any more. Unfortunately, it wasn't red enough to hold up it's color after baking. No matter, though, since it was purely aesthetic and had no bearing on the flavor. Typically when I make whoopie pies (which is fairly often), I double the filling recipe because I like lots of filling, but that wasn't needed here. With the recipe made as written and scooped with a #20 cookie scoop, I ended up with 11 generously-filled whoopie pies. I actually had enough filling left over for maybe another 2 or 3 pies, but I had run out of cookies to fill. I guess I'll just have to find something else to do with the leftovers (dip for teddy grahams, perhaps?). Thanks for posting, I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I THANK YOU! I didn't have any steak but I did have a nice chuck roast. You know the drill, buy what's on sale cheap then figure out something neat to do with it.

Then I added 1/4 tsp dried Chipotle powder to the flour, salt, and black pepper I coated the steak with. I didn't have any lemons so I sliced up a key lime.(I like Cuba Libres so I usually have key limes on hand.) I drained the oil but kept the limes. I sliced 2 small sweet spanish onions. I also kept the 4 cloves of garlic, I do like my garlic. I used 1/2 cup of mixed red, yellow, & green bell peppers. I had a half dozen fresh button mushrooms which I thickly sliced & sauted in extra virgin olive oil. I served it on a bed of Basmati rice. As I was putting it all together I couldn't help thinking, all one would have to do is change the stock from beef to chicken and they could use skinned & browned  chicken thighs or breasts and what about pork chops.

I used round steak and a really good Lager beer.  I also used fresh mushrooms, a medium vidalia onion and included the lemons, oil and browned bits after searing the round steak.  I think next time the only adjustment I will make is to omit a tablespoon or two of the brown sugar and I don't think I will include the lemon while baking.

They softened to play dough consistency & even though I used a heavy duty freezer bag, and multiple 10 second zaps in microwave, they melted the plastic without melting the chips beyond thick play dough!! Yes, this was getting REALLY hot to knead! I dumped them into a bowl & the lump split open, revealing a coarse grainy consistency with brownish patches inside! I tried to ressurect them with a couple of tablespoons of butter (which sizzled when mixing with lumpo) but yielded a grainy mess, which idiotically, I tried to smear on the surface of the bars. Not pretty. I should have known beeter than to use microwave & plastic - these new-fangled techniques rarely turn out well for me. DH likes them - we will see how the pan gets consumed.

The red pepper flakes add just the right amount of heat, and the thyme, onions, and ham add a ton of flavor to the normally bland black-eyed peas. I love that this dish has collard greens - I had actually never had them before and this was a great introduction. <br/><br/>I have a 4 quart slow cooker so I do 2/3's of a batch which fills it up just right. Seasoned cans of black-eyed peas (like Glory or Luck's) add a noticeable amount more flavor - so if using unseasoned/unsalted black-eyed peas, you may want to compensate by adding more salt and possibly some bacon or additional ham (you also may want more salt if you are using reduced sodium broth). I often use turkey ham instead of regular ham and it still tastes great (it is cheaper and low fat). My husband has never enjoyed black-eyed pea dishes on New Year's prior to this recipe and actually asks for this one multiple times throughout the year. <br/><br/>I like to cut up the ham and all of the veggies the day before, so I can simply throw it all in the crock pot in the morning.

I searched the site with every possible word combination and finally found this recipe by using just the word ground. I had a new jar of tahini on hand and used panko breadcrumbs and fried the patties in an electic fryer skillet in peanut oil at about 370 degrees or a little hotter. In the meat mixture I used honey instead of brown sugar, only because it was already out on the counter!  I have a pretty big family so I used about 2 1/2 pounds of ground dark meat turkey,about a third of a cup of soy sauce, 2 eggs and about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh green onions and about a tablespoon or more of grated fresh ginger.  I also added a couple of minced garlic cloves and a few dried red pepper flakes. I had some leftover sake so I made a sake-teriyaki sesame sauce which I reduced and served hot with the patties.  I also made some sticky jasmine rice which was delicious.  Next time I think I will add a little salt to the ground meat mixture.  I didn't add any because I expected the soy sauce to make it salty enough.  They were still great and I'm sure I'll make them again! I might make a spicy satay type sauce to go with them next time. Also, I think these would be good using leftover cooked turkey or chicken chopped up to the same degree that you would have lump crabmeat for crab-cakes, you know? Add a few breadcrumbs and then put these together with the same ingredients as the recipe, but they would have a little more texture than when they are made with raw ground meat."},{"name":"paula deen s magical peanut butter cookies","steps":"preheat the oven to 350 degrees f', 'grease a large baking sheet', 'in a mixing bowl , combine the peanut butter , 1 cup of splenda , the egg , and vanilla', 'stir well with a spoon', 'roll the dough into balls the size of walnuts', 'place the balls on the prepared cookie sheet', 'with a fork dipped in optional 1 / 3 cup of splenda to prevent sticking , press a criss-cross design on each cookie', 'bake for 12 minutes , remove from the oven , and sprinkle the cookies with the optional 1 / 3 cup of splenda', 'cool slightly before removing from the pan'","description":"these cookies are made using a sugar replacement, so they are perfect for those diet-conscious snackers and/or diabetics.  these would also be great cookies for someone on the atkins diet.","ingredients":"peanut butter', 'sugar substitute', 'egg', 'vanilla extract'","review":"Loooooved these!  I ate 2 whole patties, which is unheard of for me - but I just couldn't help myself.  They were so tasty!  I did 4 x the recipe, in hopes of having leftovers.  The only thing I didn't x4 was the eggs, I used only 3. They were cooked in the oven and took about 40 minutes for me (perhaps I made mine bigger than yours).  They were very moist and had a great texture.  Not to mention the flavor was lovely!  We were running late last night, but next time I would make a Thai dipping sauce or maybe even a chili maynnaise...  Oh and I will up the ginger next time too, that sounds good.

I want to thank you for a marvelous corned beef dinner for our Saturday! There are a couple things that are different than your recipe. First, I didn't have any apple juice, so I used beef broth/water and sliced up a couple of apples to cook with the brisket. I didn't have any carrots, so I just left them out of the dinner, but not purposely. I just didn't have time to run out to get carrtos, and I wanted to get the dinner into the pot.

A little spare in amounts, though.  I used half of a medium yellow onion, chopped, and a large garlic clove, minced.  Since I wasn't using leftovers, I started by putting water on to boil for the shrimp, then put my rice in my rice cooker.  I used Recipe #18157 because I am not too big on canned soups, so I measured out the dry ingredients for this while the shrimp boiled, then used the water from the shrimp to reconstitute the soup, trying to give it some shrimp flavor.  I drained and peeled the shrimp, and defrosted a 16oz bag of frozen broccoli.  Then I sauteed the onion and garlic in about a tablespoon of butter, and continued on with the recipe as stated, subbing 2 cups of shredded colby jack for the velveeta.  Because I didn't have any children to feed last night, I added some Tony Cachere's seasoning (and could have added more!).  Topped with cracker crumbs and let sit a few minutes to meld.  Yum!  I recommend having this recipe on hand for leftovers to reduce the work, although it was only about 30 minutes from start to finish (the rice finished cooking just at the right moment to put it in the casserole!).  I bet this recipe would be 5 stars nummy with leftover shrimp from a crawfish boil, though!  I'll have to try that next year.
