I did not want to review after the first time I made it, because I hate giving less than 3 star reviews and I thought in all fairness, it deserved a 2nd chance and some fine tuning.  \\n\\nThis time, this is what I did:  after cubing the potatos, I took the olive oil, garlic, sage, rosemary, salt  and pepper and placed in in a bowl by it's self without the potatos. ***Now instead of 8 cloves of garlic, I used the minced garlic that you purchase in a jar.  I put about 2 tablespoons of that minced garlic into the herb mixture instead.  I then mixed the herb miture really well, and let it sit at room tempeture for about 30 minutes.  Then I dipped the potatoes one by one in the mixture then dumped them into the crockpot.  I also used a crockpot instead of the oven, I thought to slow cooker would give the herbs a chance to better infuse themselves together.  I cooked it on High for 4 hours.  A couple of times an hour, I mixed the potato mixture in the crockpot well, to be sure every peice of potato was covered. Also, I didn't want to mixture to gravitate to the bottom of the pot and burn.  When finished, the potatoes were perfect.  They were moist, the rosemary was not dry and stick-like, the garlic was subtle and not over powering.  All in all, this time it came out perfect.

They were perfect together; it was yummy, and something I would never have thought of doing. As far as the prep directions, I would have to give 3 stars. I found some problems and changed some things. I browned the chicken first, removed it from the pan, and then added the garlic & cumin for 2 minutes. I felt they would get a little bitter after cooking in the pan for 2 minutes, and then another 2-3 minutes at a medium-high setting to brown the chicken. Using just the 1/4 cup lemon juice wasn't enough to make the carrots soft. After 30 minutes total as the recipe stated to cook the carrots and chicken, the chicken was done and the carrots were still quite hard. Next time, I'd parboil them separately and add them for the last 10 minutes the chicken was cooking. The lemon juice got quite dark and thick in the pan, so next time I'll add a little chicken broth to make a nicer sauce. Finally, when preparing the rice, after the rice has boiled and set on a burner to simmer, it will be ready when the entire meal is prepped and cooked. I don't think it has to be made ahead of time.

Loved the texture of the applesauce but it was a little too sweet for my taste and the cinnnamon stronger than we prefer. A granddaughter asked me to make this applesauce so that she can take some back to her college dorm so today I made a triple batch in my large InstaPot.

Maybe that was my fault, I used 1% milk, and maybe that didn't have enough fat to hold it together, I'm not sure....but even so the taste wasn't good enough for me to try again.  The meat mixture itself wasn't bad, but still not what I was expecting.  I was glad I cut down the steak sauce.  I think it would have been too pronounced if I had used the whole 1/4 cup.

My tofu absorbed all of the marinade within about 10 minutes, so there was nothing to spread in the skillet.

Kitten I chose this recipe for two reasons.  First, because no one else has rated it before, I wanted to be the first.  Knowing its your recipe I had no doubt it was going to be excellent.  Second it reminded me of something my grandmother would have made.   She baked with dates quite often and she added almond extract to all her baking and I use it all the time as well just for the memories.  As well as I got to use her mini loaf pans which I rarely use.  Anyways about the loaves....the only change I made was using slivered almonds instead of pecans because it was what I had on had.  These little beauties are in my permanent baking file, I tell you they are awesome.  The almond flavoring  and the cinnamon together puts me on cloud nine.  I had to bake mine a few minutes extra but that isnt unusual for my oven.  They rose up so nice with a crisp top that I love.  I couldnt wait for them too cool so I sliced one and had it with butter...out of this world.  I have wrapped two for my baking trays for xmas but I don't think they will make it, I think they will be made again before the trays are given.  I am going to buy some pecans and make them both ways I think.  Thank you Kitten for the wonderful recipes you have shared with us all.

Although this is not the absolute best cinnamon bread I've ever had, I'm giving it five stars because it is very, very good -- and it's so extremely easy to make.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and reduced the fat in it -- I used light sour cream, reduced the butter to two tablespoons, and used 6 tablespoons of applesauce in place of the remaining butter.  I may get jiggy with it (to quote Seinfeld) and replace all the butter next time, as well as using whole wheat pastry flour ... what's the worst that can happen?  Anyway, this was great -- thanks for posting it."},{"name":"scrambled huevos rancheros","steps":"in medium bowl combine eggs and milk', 'beat well', 'in medium skillet melt margarine and add egg mixture and cook until eggs are done', 'stir in cheese', 'to serve , spoon eggs onto warm tortillas', 'top with salsa , roll up and serve'","description":"spicy egg breakfast.  use mild salsa for the kids and then kick it up for yourself with some tabasco sauce.","ingredients":"eggs', 'milk', 'margarine', 'mexican blend cheese', 'flour tortillas', 'salsa'","review":"I have to bake mine for 55 minutes instead.
