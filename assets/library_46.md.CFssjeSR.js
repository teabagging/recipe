Well, I've learnt from other recipes that I've made that using two different onions - leeks and regular - is an irresistibly delicious blend; and I do love garlic, so I often increase that. I've only ever had one complaint about how much garlic I use - from my brother, about thirty years ago. Maybe everyone else has just been too polite! But it wasn't just me who loved this soup. Fortunately, I'd erred on the side of generosity with ALL my ingredients so that my three guests were able to come back for seconds - and they wanted the recipe. I served the soup with dollops of Greek yoghurt.  And - I just remembered - I added a pinch (about 1/4 teaspoon) of nutmeg in step two. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe, Boomette.

I then added the egg and vanilla to the sugar and butter mixture. I thnk that I didn't allow the sugar/butter to cool long enough because the eggs began to cook a little which made the straining difficult and I think was the main reason my pie was so soupy...not enough egg made it through the strainer.

Normally I take a big slice, and this time I could only have two bites of the store bought pie!!

I made this for my boyfriend and his roommates and it was gone in a day, and I&#039;ve been getting requests to make it ever since! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I followed the steps exactly, but I added the butter to the sugar/corn syrup mix after removing it off the heat so it could melt easier. Then I followed the rest of the steps exactly. At first I only baked it for 30 minutes because it looked ready and the pie crust was starting to brown and I didn&#039;t want it to burn. I took it out and realized about an hour later that it definitely needed more time in the oven. I was hesitant about putting it back in the oven after it had sat out for so long, but put it back anyway. After an additional 20-25 minutes in the oven, it turned out perfectly! I definitely recommend leaving it the oven for the recommended time, and next time I will reduce the temperature of my boyfriend&#039;s oven because I think it is not completely accurate. Not sure if using a glass pie pan had an affect on the quick browning of the pie crust or not, or if the rack being set one higher than the center position of the oven had to do with it.

I will definitely make that as a baked side dish all by itself in the future.  It's very tasty and has a pot pie reminiscence about it.  As far as the rest of the recipe with the crust and all though...  it was WAY too much crust to attempt to balance out the inside, and the crust was a little of a pain (doesn't want to roll out very well), so it was annoying to avoid it while eating after it took so much effort.  Have to say though that it did create one of the best smells through the house (I think it was the cider vinegar in the crust that did that.  I'd never heard of adding cider vinegar to a dough before, and it created a really nice savory smell.)  Perhaps if crust is wished, I'd say half the recipe, and criss-cross it over the top only.

I think of the two batches, I preferred the first however. The flavor is delicious and I wasn't disappointed.  I used a square mini scone pan that made 16 pre-shaped mini scones, and they were perfectly sized and popped right out of the pan.  I did find that you have to press the dough into the corners, and the top isn't perfectly smooth - these don't spread out and fill the gaps and get a smooth top like cookie dough. I also had to cook them just a few extra minutes so they wouldn't be dough-y in the center.
