The potatoes are fantastic to balance some of the sour notes of lemon and cilantro. Arugula with the  herb flavour and the fennel bulbs are gorgeous.

There were a couple of things I did different due to necessity.  When I decided on the recipe...it was too late to make in my slowcooker...so I used my Guardian Service Roaster on top of the stove.  Like one of the other reviewers I browned the porksteaks first, after I seasoned them with salt and lots of black pepper since several other reviewers said it was a little bland.  I also substituted carrots for the green pepper like another reviewer and added an extra can of stewed tomatoes since my DH loves them.  By the time the meat was tender, about 1 1/2 hour later, much of the liquid was cooked away having reduced to an almost concentrated amount.  I added a couple of cups of water removed the meat while thickening.  Removed the bones from the meat which left nice good sized pieces and blended them in the sauce/vegetable mixture.  I served it over rice and it was wonderful.  My DH said, this is kind of like a Sweet n Sour dish...but with more flavor and a little kick of spice.

Me personally I change it a little I prefer to cut the chops up into bite size bits. I don't care for celery so I leave that out. I also add the green pepper about 30 min to an hour (depending on how fast your crock pot cooks) before serving. Also for the last 30 min I cook on high (after adding the cornstarch).I find it makes the veggies less mushy. Salt and pepper to taste. I usually double the recipe because it seems to be a favorite.

I followed the recipe for all other ingredients, in proportion. I can't really think of a better way to do grilled chicken than this. Thank you so much for a lovely recipe.
