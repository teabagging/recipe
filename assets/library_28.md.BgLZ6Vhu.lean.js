My DH, on the other hand, thought it was really great, hence the 4 stars. Like other reviewers, I sprinkled lemon juice on the scallops before breading them, and did finish them in the oven. Next time, I think I'll put them on a parchment paper lined sheet and do them completely in the oven at about 350 F. for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of the scallops.

I used 3 cups of macaroni, so I had one serving leftover.

Tip: place a clean dish towel or double layer of paper towel under the crockpot lid to keep the moisture/water from dripping back down into the Mac and cheese. Oh and do not use pre shredded cheese!

I used the syrup, but skipped the glaze so that this wouldn't be too sweet for us. The flavor was really good. I did have a big problem getting this out of the pan though, it did not come out in one piece. I think it is because all the syrup made it extremely moist (even with pouring it slowly, it took a long time for it to absorb). I have used the toothpick and syrup method before with success, but I think only with overlapping parchment in a loaf pan so it was very easy to pull out. I think the workaround here is to cool the cake a bit, remove it to parchment paper and then very slowly pour the syrup on to it. Hopefully that will work, because the amount of citrus and cranberries pack a flavor punch that is really wonderful in this."},{"name":"pork and beef broccoli wontons","steps":"steam the broccoli florets until just tender', 'drain and then chop very small', 'in a medium bowl combine ground beef and pork with chopped broccoli and all remaining ingredients', 'mix well to combine', 'chill for a minumum of 4 hors', 'place several wrappers on a surface', 'brush edges lightly with water', 'place 1 heaping teaspoon of the meat mixture into the center of each wrapper', 'fold the warppers diagonally in half , pressing edges to seal', 'place wontons on waxed paper', 'repeat with remaining meat mixture and wrappers', 'heat oil in a large heavy skillet', 'add in the wontons and fry until they are golden and the filling is cooked through', 'you can keep them warm in a 250 degree oven while frying the remaining wontons'","description":"make certain to cut the florets very small for this, no need to pre-cook the beef/pork mixture, it will cook in the oil. this recipe should make about 40-45 wontons using 1 heaping teaspoon of meat mixture, the recipe can easily be doubled. you can use all ground pork (1/2-pound) if desired. plan ahead the meat mixture must be chilled for a minumum of 4 hours or overnight before using. serve with your favorite dipping sauce --- i have made these many times in the past they are really good and makes a great finger food for a get together! :)","ingredients":"fresh broccoli florets', 'ground beef', 'ground pork', 'green onions', 'fresh garlic', 'fresh ginger', 'soy sauce', 'egg', 'black pepper', 'salt', 'wonton wrappers', 'oil'","review":"I used to live in Swansea Ma., and went to Nick&#039;s all the time.

I had to dig it out with a spatula.  So, it didn't look as pretty as it should have.  My advice is to spray the bowl, line it with plastic wrap, spray the wrap, then place the ingredients inside.

So, being even lazier (and running out of time) I purchased ready made vanilla and chocolate cupcakes and proceeded to take all of the frosting off of them.  I then reapplied a thinner layer of white frosting on each cupcake.  I poked the two holes in the top with a toothpick, and then I used a small tube of red gel to fill in the holes and make a thin strip leading from the hole to the end of the cupcake.  They came out looking really cool!  I made these for a New Moon screening party that my friends and I had (ironically we are women in our thirties, with husbands and kids, but we still swooned over Edward).  I called these Edward's Bite Cupcakes.  The rest of our menu consisted of 'Bat Wings' with Jacob 'Black and Blue' cheese dip, Pulled-Pork-Me-Edward Sliders, 'Once-Bitten' baked beans, 'Bella Swan' brussel sprouts, garlic fries, and pasta and cucumber 'Cullen' salad.

There were sweet notes of the pineapple and it was still visible and pretty after the four hours cooking. The green bell peppers gave a wonderful flavor and the sour notes from the other ingredients just really were all spot on! I used 2 large green bell peppers and I'm glad I did because I like them and they cook down quite a bit. I LOVE the use of quick-cooking tapioca as a thickener because it is pretty much tasteless (I usually avoid cornstarch in large amounts because it lends a sort of bitter taste to sauces in my opinion).
