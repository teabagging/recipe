I had to get creative with the juices, as there were no plain mango or cran-mango available.  We ended up with two frozen concentrates: one orange-mango juice & one cranberry-pomegranate juice.  We used 3 Tablespoons of concentrate & 1/2 cup water for each called for amount of juice.  We really enjoyed it.  The color was also really pretty.

I do have a few comments though. The taste was thru the roof- easily 10 stars, but my omelette made as directed got way more browned than I normally would like. After beating the egg whites to stiff peaks and folding in the yolk mixture I could not pour the mixture into my pan but rather spread it in. I used 1 tbsp of butter as I didn't see it in the directions and I thought that was a pretty standard amount. I used medium low-medium heat and had to cover the pan as the bottom was cooking so fast and the top not yet done. I couldn't spread the mascarpone mixture because the top was so delicate but rather plopped it on in small spoonfuls.

I made some modifications. (I didn't have enough oreos for 24 cupcakes...I only had 6 so I just made one third of the recipe instead).    Instead of using the whole oreo sandwich at the bottom, I just separated each oreo, scraped the cream off, and used each oreo half in the bottom of the cupcake liners(ended up getting 8 cupckaes that way). With the remaining oreos (about 4 oreos), I crushed them and mixed them into the cream cheese mixture.  I also added vanilla into the cream cheese mixture.  I spooned about a tablespoon of cream cheese mixture into each cupcake liner and baked for 17 minutes.  It was fantastic.  I gave it 4 stars because it definitely needs the vanilla.  To save some time, there's no need to crush the oreos to make the bottom crust, after baking, the oreo at the bottom of the cupcake liner softens up quite nicely, and is delicious (it doesn't stay crunchy at all).

Here's the changes I made if anyone wants to give it a whirl.  I didn't have any Italian Seasoning dressing mix, so I made my own..first YUM.  I increased and substituted the water with white wine.  Since I had to start with frozen chicken breast, I cooked that on low all day.  I then discovered I didn't have any cream cheese on hand, so I substituted sour cream.  Mixed that with Crm of Chicken soup.  Was a little too thick, so added some chicken stock to thin it out.  Added a small can of mushrooms (with the juice) and tossed in a few more tsps of the dressing mix and some grated Parm cheese...another YUM accomplished. Poured that over the chicken and cranked the slow cooker to high for another 1 1/2.  The last 30 mins I tossed in a bag of frozen peas.  Served this over buttered noodles.

There was an excellent mild teriyaki flavor, and the chicken was perfectly moist. I'll definitely be making this again, and I think next time I might cook the sauce on the stovetop first, before putting it in the oven with the chicken, just to thicken it up a little, since the chicken breasts don't need to cook for as long as bone-in chicken pieces.

On the one hand, the ribs turned out to be the most tender I&#039;ve ever made, without being TOO tender....  just perfect really.  On the other hand, the BBQ glaze was problematic from the very beginning.  When I read the reviews here complaining about the glaze, I went to the food network website and looked up the same recipe.  The reviewers there had the same issues with the sauce as well!  Ultimately, I decided to use half the amount of dry rub.  Once the ribs were done cooking, I drained the foil and got my liquid out and it was almost half oil.  I had to skim it for a long time before the glaze even started to reduce, and by that time everyone was hungry and the ribs were getting cold so I glazed them with bottled BBQ sauce instead.  I still kept an eye on the reducing sauce while we were eating though, and added a small can of tomato paste.  Once the glaze was ready (after everyone finished eating), it was indeed a bit on the salty side- but not unbearably so, at least for me.  I can&#039;t imagine how salty it would&#039;ve been if I had used all the dry rub!  We ate the leftover ribs the next day with the homemade BBQ sauce and even used it for dipping dinner rolls into.  I have to say, if it wasn&#039;t so salty it would&#039;be been the best BBQ sauce I&#039;ve ever had.  If you&#039;re making the glaze, do what I did and use half the amount of dry rub, skim the oil off the surface of the sauce and add an 8oz can of tomato paste.  It will still be quite salty though, and will take very long to reduce."},{"name":"fried chicken with cashew nuts","steps":"put the 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or pan and over a low head add the cashew nuts and keep stirring until they become golden brown in colour', don't look away as they burn in a flash !, 'remove from oil and set aside', 'using the same pan add the rest of the oil , add the chopped garlic , when golden add the chicken and onion - stir-fry for about 10 minutes', 'add all the sauce ingredients to the chicken mixture', 'add the cashew nuts , stir-fry for about 2 minutes', 'remove from the heat and serve garnished with the sliced chilli and spring onion', 'serve with rice'","description":"yes, another chicken with cashew dish - this one is a thai style and there is quiet alot of liquid. its a very tasty dish, its also quick & simple to make and great served with rice.  i sometimes increase the chicken to about 500g and still leave all the other ingredients the same.  you can also use less oil if you are using a non-stick pan","ingredients":"chicken breasts', 'cashew nuts', 'garlic', 'onion', 'red chile', 'spring onion', 'peanut oil', 'wine', 'oyster sauce', 'soy sauce', 'fish sauce', 'palm sugar'","review":"I reviewed this recipe once but it disappeared.
