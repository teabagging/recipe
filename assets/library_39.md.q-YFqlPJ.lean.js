I had on hand.. a very small amount of portuguese chorizo sausage, large rounds of salami and 2 cooked rookworsts ( = large smoked sausages, similar-ish to frankfurters), the pizza bases came from Ecoplaza (totally organic grocery) it's the first time I tried these and they taste great!

We also added a little green pepper and these cooked up in no time. Please see my rating system: 5 stars for using leftover meats successfully, WITH organic bases successfully, for letting DD loose in the kitchen and having fun AND getting her to happily eat the end result.

I did some research on this recipe, as Annacia's recipes have always surpassed the exceptional point. What I found is this recipe is so close to a shrimp gumbo I am not sure you could get any closer. First off, let's start with the roux. Cajun gumbo historically has a darker roux, which this has. A beautiful rich roux, that encases all the tastes and slickness of the mighty base of this dish. Secondly, it includes the Holy Trinity ~ peppers, onions, and celery. A must, and a absolute must. Okra thickens the roux even further, or the use of file-powder can be used instead, but not with the recipe. I made one small change, when cooking the shrimp, I kept their shells on, removing when finished, and making a shrimp broth (from the water from the shrimp and adding the shells which made a rich broth of delicious-ness). Instead of the beef broth I did use the shrimp broth. Other then that, followed this exactly and what a grand taste this is. I used the optional *Hot Sauce* as I love all things hot, but this is such a brightly tasting gumbo, you really truly don't need it. Oh, I wish we had more. .

I used regular yeast, and because of a recent problem  with another recipe, I proofed it for 5 minutes with the milk warmed to 115 degrees along with one tablespoon of sugar.

I mixed the whole thing in my Cuisinart it only took about 2 minutes to mix and the dough was perfect with the stated amount of flour. I subbed brown sugar for the turbinado, I also added a tsp of cinnamon to the syrup. My only complaint with this recipe is that I found it a  confusing to follow, as it seems to jump around.  I had to keep reading it over and over to make sure I was doing it right and still missed something. I wish the glaze was listed as part of the filling - I some how missed that it went on the dough before cooking. Usually glaze is added at the end of a recipe, my brain didn't register it after the rolling instructions. That aside not having the glaze didn't seem to make any difference that I could tell, everyone throughly enjoyed them. Wished I had put the pan on a bigger one as suggested - they did goo all over LOL. Instead of turning the pan over onto a platter when done, I lifted the rolls out with a fork turned them sticky side down and them spooned the goo out of the cups onto the tops of the rolls. Next time I might increase the syrup amount and cook the extra in a separate dish so they can be even gooeyier.

We always cooked the pork a little first and drained the fat, then added all the other ingredients, but that was back when undercooked pork was considered far more hazardous. Still, a great many people prefer to cook it first. I add a small amount of finely chopped cilantro (Chinese parsley) to the mix.

I have the pages in storage somewhere, but I wanted the magazine again.  In future, I will keep the magazines!  Anyway, this is the first and only Linzer Cookie recipe I&#039;ve ever cared to make.

I think it has potential but as it now is I can only give it 3 stars. This recipe does not make light fluffy biscuits they turned out dense and on the chewy side. Not bad if you know to expect that. They baked to a lovely light golden color at the 20 min mark (I used the convection cycle to give them the best possible chance). I got 18 standard sized biscuits. I use an old can for cutting that I have been using for all of 30 yrs, it once held veggies of some sort so you know the size. Even with a generous TBS of baking powder they didn't rise very well.

As a random side note, it also reheated really well, which meant tasty leftovers for work the next day.  \\n\\nThanks!"},{"name":"roasted apple and cheddar salad","steps":"preheat oven to 400f', 'to prepare dressing: whisk vinegar , apple juice , 1 tablespoon oil , honey , mustard , salt and pepper in a small bowl', 'to roast apples and prepare salad: toss apples with 2 teaspoons oil and thyme in a medium bowl', 'spread evenly on a baking sheet', 'roast , turning once or twice , until the apples are soft and golden , 25 to 30 minutes', 'discard fresh thyme , if using', 'let cool', 'while the apples are roasting , toast walnuts in a small baking pan until fragrant , about 5 minutes', 'let cool', 'just before serving , combine spinach , lettuce and endive in a large bowl', 'toss gently to mix', 'divide the greens among 6 plates , drizzle with dressing and top with cheese , roasted apples , walnuts and dried cranberries', 'serve immediately'","description":"recipe from eating well and placed here for safe keeping.  they say you can easily sub pears for the apples if you like. . .heck, i used some of each!  this recipe is low carb, diabetic appropriate, low calorie, high fiber and gluten free - so it's a good one to serve at a party because it is sure to please everyone!  and don't get hung up on the endive in the recipe; i know it's expensive and i just subbed it out for more spinach.  i might also suggest a sprinkle of craisins or dried tart cherries on top; i felt it needed that since the apples/pears get super sweet in the oven and the tartness really brought everything together!  make ahead tip: cover and refrigerate dressing (step 2) for up to 1 week.","ingredients":"red wine vinegar', 'apple juice', 'olive oil', 'honey', 'dijon mustard', 'salt', 'fresh ground pepper', 'apples', 'fresh thyme', 'walnuts', 'baby spinach', 'boston lettuce', 'curly endive lettuce', 'sharp cheddar cheese', 'dried cranberries'","review":"I really liked this, as I am a blue cheese LOVER!!!  I never thought of adding it to veggies other then salads.  I really liked this so much , the kids were a little squeemish at first, since the cheese is so sharp but they came around and enjoyed it too.  I plan on making this sometime during the holidays while my family is home, they will LOVE it too."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const t=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.name.toLowerCase().includes(t)||a.steps.toLowerCase().includes(t)||a.description.toLowerCase().includes(t)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},G=["disabled"],R={key:0},P={key:1};function F(a,t,i,c,r,s){const u=m("PoemCard");return o(),n("section",null,[t[3]||(t[3]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ recipe ü•≥")])],-1)),e("div",L,[t[2]||(t[2]=e("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),g(e("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":t[0]||(t[0]=l=>r.searchQuery=l),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[f,r.searchQuery]])]),e("div",N,[(o(!0),n(b,null,w(s.filteredPoems,(l,p)=>(o(),y(u,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:t[1]||(t[1]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(o(),n("span",P,"Loading...")):(o(),n("span",R,"See more"))],8,G)):k("",!0)])}const V=d(B,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-db8e64f4"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/39.md","filePath":"library/39.md"}'),Y={name:"library/39.md"},Z=Object.assign(Y,{setup(a){return(t,i)=>(o(),n("div",null,[v(V)]))}});export{K as __pageData,Z as default};
