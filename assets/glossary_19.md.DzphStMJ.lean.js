On that batch I went to the trouble of picking the skins off of all those chickpeas in a double batch.  I would probably never go to that length for a family snack, but it was so silky smooth.

I saw the same recipe online, by Shulman and had to make it right away and it is fabulous. My BF said he'd try it but hated Lima beans (which is what the recipe I saw called for).  Well, after eating he said-   you've even made Lima beans taste good  ;)  I didn't mention to him what a super-food kale is or how much protein is in the beans  <br/> I recommend blanching the kale- well worth the time. Do soak your own legumes overnight and use freshly cooked beans- canned beans are no match in flavor and texture IMO.  I used large Limas but have baby Limas in the cupboard for the next time since I prefer a smaller bean.  This dish is fine enough for the holiday table as a side dish to a hearty roast beef or as a meatless casserole style main dish anytime.  <br/>The taste is wonderful - kale is flavorful, softened and not bitter, the tomato taste is not overwhelming, and Limas worked very well with it all (even using the large ones they were indeed very velvety and creamy), it has a very 'rich' taste and flavor for a bean dish and it all blends well once you take a bite.Though I didn't seem to get too much caramelizing as much as a sauce- maybe taking the lid off of  the casserole dish for a little longer might have done the trick. Leftovers tasted even a bit better,as always - so cooking them in the Do Ahead way might also be better. <br/><br/> Though I did not have the Herbs de Provence, I used what I had. Finding the savory took a trip to a few places.  Later, I did manage to find H de P, in a local health food store that sells spices from bulk much less expensive than the supermarkets!, so now I have that for next time, which will be within the week!"},{"name":"barley and edamame salad  ww","steps":"bring water to a boil in a saucepan and then add the barley', 'reduce heat and simmer covered for 25 minutes', 'drain in a colander and rinse under cold water', 'drain again', 'transfer to a large bowl', 'stir in remainder of the ingredients and toss to combine', 'serve chilled or at room temperature'","description":"5 points plus /serving recipe source: ww power foods cookbook","ingredients":"water', 'pearl barley', 'frozen edamame', 'carrot', 'rice vinegar', 'soy sauce', 'ginger', 'sesame oil'","review":"Absolutely awewome.

Please consider changing your directions appropriately. Today&#039;s tomatoes are not as acidic as they were when your ancestors were canning them, and adjustments must be made accordingly.

It's a recipe that stands up well.  However, over the years, I've altered it a little.  Here are my changes:<br/><br/>Instead of pinto beans, we use red beans.  Red kidneys are okay but actually use red beans which are smaller and more tender.<br/><br/>Instead of parsley we use cilantro.  When this recipe was first developed, cilantro was not commonly available in the US.  Gives it a more authentic flavor.<br/><br/>Instead of canned whole tomatoes, use crushed tomatoes.  makes the chili less watery.<br/><br/>Add chopped Chipotle peppers to give it a smoky, spicier flavor.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, we usually triple the recipe and don't add beans, and then freeze the chili in quart containers.  Then when we thaw it out, we add the beans.

First, there is a tremendous amount of ricotta cheese in a recipe that doesn't really make a cheesecake.  I also don't know why the recipe calls for marble cake mix.  I didn't know what to do with the cocoa packet.  I tossed it in with the rest of the cake mix.  I think that was a mistake.  Between the chocolate in the cake mix, the carrots, the butterscotch chips and the almond extract, there were too many conflicting flavors in the cake, and they did not go well together.  Also, with the sugar that's already in the cake mix, the sugar in the butterscotch chips and an additional cup of sugar, that's A LOT of sugar.  Then there's almost 5 cups of sugar in the frosting.  I just found the cake too sweet for us.  At 350 degrees for well over an hour (it took about 1 1/2 hours till the skewer came out clean), the high temp caused the ricotta in the cake to crack the top, like a cheesecake, but the frosting could cover that up.  If using the full two cups of ricotta I should have baked the cake at a lower temp for longer.  I would definitely try it again, but leave out the carrots and cut back to maybe one cup of ricotta cheese.  I would also cut back on the sugar, and probably just dust the cake with some powdered sugar instead of frosting it.

I made sure that there was no airspace in the bottle when I first made it and every couple of days I would gently invert the bottle a few times so the berries would flow from top to bottom.

When I looked at your recipes, I thought oh, I like mushrooms, I hope these fried ones don't turn out too greasy.. and I wasn't disappointed!  Here's the formal review:\\n\\nI put flour, egg, and breadcrumbs in seperate cereal bowls because nothing else was  clean.  I didn't use nearly the full amount of flour; half would have been sufficient.  The egg got pretty well used up since it wasn't beaten to a smithereen.  I started out with about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and that was perfect.  However, the mushrooms I used were about 1-1.5 in diameter, thus less coating.  I would recommend a smaller mushroom to get more of that bread-crumby-goodness on each mushroom.  By the time I got done breading all of the mushrooms, the first ones were set enough to fry.  I heated my oil a little hot, I think, as it took about 20 seconds for them to be a nice dark gold color.  They were putting off a ton of steam; thus, little grease.  For fun, I double dipped one of them (flour, egg, crumbs, egg, crumbs) and it came out a little crunchier, but nothing special.  They were eaten within minutes of frying, and the 2 reasons it took us that long were, well, they started out dang hot, and I snapped a pic.  They were nice and juicey on the inside with a burst of wonderul mushroom flavor, and tasty crunchy stuff on the outside.  My husband says to add salt, but I liked them as-were.  This is a must for sides in the future.  I would recomend serving them post-haste as they lose heat pretty quickly."},{"name":"basic white bread  kitchenaid","steps":"combine milk , sugar , salt , and butter in small saucepan', 'heat over low heat until butter melts and sugar dissolves', 'cool to lukewarm', 'dissolve yeast in warm water in warmed bowl', 'add lukewarm milk mixture and 4 1 / 2 cups flour', 'attach bowl and dough hook', 'turn to speed 2 and mix 1 minute', 'continuing on speed 2 , add remaining flour , 1 / 2 cup at a time , until dough clings to hook and cleans side of bowl', 'knead on speed 2 for 2 minutes longer , or until dough is smooth and elastic', 'dough will be slightly sticky to the touch', 'place in a greased bowl , turning to grease top', 'cover', 'let rise in warm place , free from draft , until doubled in bulk , about an hour', 'punch dough down and divide in half', 'shape each half into a loaf and place in a greased 8 1 / 2 x 4 1 / 2 x 2 1 / 2-inch loaf pan', 'cover', 'let rise in warm place , free from draft , until doubled in bulk , about 1 hour', 'bake at 400 degrees f for 30 minutes', 'remove from pans immediately and cool on wire racks', 'when using for bierocks , after dough rises first time , cut dough in 12 pieces', 'roll each piece into a circle', 'fill with hamburger cabbage filling', 'spoon the filling in the middle of the circle then pinch the edges together and fold the ends in and place on greased baking sheet', 'brush with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse ground pepper and salt', 'bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes', 'cool on rack'","description":"i've tried to find this recipe on the web and can't find it.\\ni use this for making bierocks. this is the kitchenaid basic white bread recipe.","ingredients":"milk', 'sugar', 'salt', 'butter', 'dry active yeast', 'warm water', 'all-purpose flour'","review":"I had the pleasure of having these made by the chef himself, so this review is based on taste only, not preparing, although I did watch.

For taste, I give it 4 stars but because of the ease and minimal dish use, I gave it the extra star.   I doubled the batch and these were some of the easiest muffins to put together...putting the oil and eggs into one measuring cup, beat with a fork to break up the eggs and then filling up to the 1 cup line is ingenious...all the wet ingredients in just the one measuing cup!    For those who say the recipe is dry, I am wondering if they are just measuring out the 1/3 cup milk and not actually putting the oil and eggs in a measuring cup and then filling it to the 1 cup mark with the milk, as the recipe stated.  I definitely think that more than 1/3 cup milk is used...it will depend on how large your eggs are.  For taste, there is something sort of missing...I wonder if vanilla would do the trick....but I suspect that those who think something's missing might prefer the tanginess in sourmilk/buttermilk batters which are also a mainstay for blueberry muffins, banana bread and other quick breads.  I tasted the muffin batter raw (gasp!) and noticed right away that it was delicious, but not at all tangy.  Finally, I used just over 1/2 the sugar called for and I did up the blueberries a bit.

Super easy.  A double-batch makes 21 muffins with a 2oz. scoop or 24 with 1 1/3oz. scoop.  2oz. scoop is equivalent to filling the muffin paper all the way to the top...this is my preferred size since it makes a very nice size muffin top!  A lot of reviewers pointed out them drying out if not eating on the first day.  I added 1/2 c. plain greek yogurt (or use sour cream) for a doubled recipe and it solved the problem.  They were still moist on day two.  However, the only one that lasted until day two was the muffin I specifically hid to test for dryness because these muffins were completely hoovered by my 4 boys and hubby.  :o)  A single batch of topping is sufficient for a double batch of muffins, IF you make the measurements just a teeny more generous.  Brown sugar tasted better than white...and always do, IMO for muffin toppings.  The butter for the topping makes a nicer texture and presentation if used &quot;really soft&quot; vs. &quot;melted&quot;.  ***Re: fresh vs. frozen blueberries ...  If using fresh, roll in flour before you fold into the batter.  It will prevent the berries from sinking to the bottom during baking.  If using frozen berries, these will turn out just as amazing but there are a few steps to prepare the berries first (I&#039;ve gone through a lot of trial and error about this.)  Take out the frozen berries and thaw in a strainer under luke warm water until the water runs clear.  Pat dry on paper towels very gently so as not to burst any berries.  Then, just like you do with the fresh berries, roll carefully in the flour to coat...they will be super fragile.  Gently fold into batter.  They will cook exactly like fresh berries and the batter will not be an icky color...it will stay white with the pop of bright juicy berries!  I love this recipe...it is my new go-to for berry muffins.
