I've done the boxed fondant before and it was ok. I wanted to try something new and I love the way fondant looks on cake and I thought fresh made would taste better. I made a two layer cake for mothers day tomorrow iced it and then did the fondant. Wow! I too did not sift and it turned out fine, but I did use the entire two pound bag, and a little extra. The more powd. sug. you use the better. I had no trouble mixing it by hand with the wood spoon, I just kept folding the mix into the sugar. You've got to really work the sugar into it so it's no longer sticky, my first try at rolling it out it stuck to the counter (luckily you can just scrape it up and ball it up again and start over.) so I suggest you let it set in the air for a while to dry out just a little. Also the more you handle it the more it warms up and will get sticky again, so keep lots of powd. sugar on hand to keep the stickiness at bay and flip it over a lot and re-powder while you are rolling out. I omitted the almond extract and did lemon extract instead to match the frosting I made. I didn't feel the sugar overpowered, it's fondant so it's supposed to taste sugary, but the lemon stood out and I think you can do as much or as little flavoring as you'd like. I also set some aside and added some color to make an accent (tho I recommend adding color to your liquid goo first if you want color!) I'm not a professional so my cake isn't perfect, but I think this is something I'll continue to do because it's so fun! The proof will be in the taste tomorrow, but otherwise, great recipe!

You have to get the whole picture, yes the sauce smells vinegary but once you marry it with the pork and the homemade coleslaw it's magic and amazing, my mouth waters just thinking about it.  The only suggestion that I have is to maybe cut the cayenne pepper in half as it is every part of this recipe, the rub, the mop sauce, bbq sauce and even the coleslaw have cayenne in it or at least seems as if it does.

On the upside they were easy and made very little mess in my kitchen. However, I know I used the right size pan so now I wonder if the biscuits I used were too big (though the recipe does specify to use the big ones and said it was okay if they overlap). I have to disagree about that as the dumplings didn't cook where they overlapped and I had a lot of overlap. I cooked for 25 minutes and then ended up flipping over the ones that were most done and setting them on top so they would cook on the bottom (10 minutes), pulled them out, spread everything else out and cooked for another 15 minutes. I did make one major change: I halved the sugar in the sauce (1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated, 1/4 cup splenda) as some of the other reviews had mentioned this being very sweet and I was afraid it would be overpoweringly so. I'm glad I did as I don't think we could have eaten this at full sweetness; it's almost hard to believe that it's a side dish rather than a dessert. The consensus on the filling was that it was rather blah and tasted like it needed something (didn't see how it would convert any sweet potatoe haters; it's really just sweet potatoes and you can really taste them, certainly didn't change DH's mind). I used 1 can buttermilk  biscuits and 1 can butter flavored, both were good with the sauce cooked in, but the butter flavored was slightly better. I think if we try these again, I would actually forget about the sweet potatoes, fill the dumplings with pumpkin pie filling and serve them with vanilla ice-cream as a dessert. Thanks for posting.

I felt adding the cake mix while the ice-cream was processing gave the mixture a gritty taste. (I tasted it a lot through the process.) I thought I added to much cake mix, because the flavor was very pronounced, but after it sat in the freezer, I couldn't even tell it was cake batter ice-cream. The ice-cream seemed to lose its flavor. I did enjoy the clumps I added after it was done freezing in the machince. It gave it the cake batter taste when I had a piece. I will try the cake mix in a different recipe by adding it before it goes into the machice so I can mix it in well. I like a smooth, not hard ice-cream. If you want an ice-cream that after freezing doesn't get rock solid, this recipe isn't for you. Maybe try, your favorite ice-cream recipe and try adding the mixture to it. I will not rate this recipe, because I feel it's my own personal opinion and others might not mind the things I do. All in all, it's not a bad ice-cream. Thanks for posting it!

Caryn (of course) asked what she should bring.  I (of course) said nothing.  Caryn (of course) did bring something, she brought this salad.  I took one spoonful, and after that I just basically parked the bowl in front of me and had 1 grilled chicken breast and 2 gallons of this salad for supper.  Dessert?  No thank you, I'll just have more salad.  Since then I've had it several times in Caryn's house, and I adore it.  I'm so pleased she posted this recipe here at Zaar, now I can have this salad anytime I like (I was running out of excuses why I kept inviting her family over for dinner on a constant basis.  Caryn thinks it's because we're good friends, it's really because of this salad).  I had half a purple cabbage in the fridge, and half a green cabbage, so I combined the two.  And I double the pecans, they are my favorite part.  I made this on a Friday afternoon for Saturday lunch, and Caryn very wisely suggested that I keep the salad, dressing and pecans separate and mix them just before serving.  This is good advice and you should all take it!  Caryn, I love you dearly, but not as much now that I can make this myself!  ;-)"},{"name":"no bake bird seed cookies","steps":"stir dry ingredients together', 'melt peanut butter and maple syrup until easily mixed', 'add vanilla', 'mix with dry ingredients until well combined', 'when cooled , roll into 1 inch balls'","description":"crunchy and easy!","ingredients":"oatmeal', 'raisins', 'sesame seeds', 'sunflower seeds', 'pure maple syrup', 'crunchy peanut butter', 'vanilla'","review":"This was wonderful.

Had it for lunch today.  I love the addition of cider vinegar to the salad dressing.  I did make a few substitutions though, because of ingredients I had on hand....or didn't have.  No fresh red onions, so I just used dried.  By time they sat in the dressing, they had softened up nicely.  I also changed the cheese.  I have these 'sting cheese' sticks that keep falling on the floor every time you open the door.  Time for those suckers to hit the road, so that's what went into the salad.  I also didn't have water chestnuts.  Too bad, cause I love the crunch.  Instead, I used diced dates.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what do dates have to do with chestnuts?  Nothing of course, but they were winking at me, so in they went.  Really added to the overall taste of the salad.  I also used fresh ground black pepper, cause frankly since Billy bought me a new pepper mill, I've been going nuts with the thing.  I also added a bit of salt, cause that's just me.

I loved it! It took me less than an hour to make (start to finish) and I love that it incorporates veggies. Next time I may try adding meat, as other reviewers have suggested to make it a complete one-dish meal.<br/><br/>The only change I made to the recipe was that I used one box of spinach, and I had thawed it so instead of cooking and cooling it before mixing it with the ricotta, I mixed the thawed spinach as is. I think if I had added the second box of spinach, the kids may have refused to eat it altogether. One liked it and the other, not so much. The only other comment I have on this recipe is that I think the final part of step 3 is missing, which is to sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the top after the last layer of ziti. I then covered with foil for 15 min and removed it for the last 10 min.

I blanched 24 ears of bi-color corn (for freezing), strained the liquid and measured 10 cups (reserved a bit more in case I needed to add it later). After cutting off the kernels I threw the cobs and 10 cups of liquid in the pot but it wasn't enough to cover the cobs! Couldn't find anyone mentioning this so I didn't add more water, just followed the recipe anyway. After boiling for 10 mins I ended up with about 7 cups of liquid so threw some out but since 10 cups wasn't enough to cover the cobs anyway I'd rather have the extra to throw away than add water in step 6. I also did a 10 minute water bath rather than turning the jars upside down. I saved the foam from step 10 and heated in the microwave on high in 30 second intervals (watch it as it boils over easily) so it would become like the other jelly again. I didn't can the foam, just let it cool a bit and put it in the fridge to use up first. It smelled great cooking, definitely reminds me of apples and something I can't quite figure out yet! Finished this 6 hours ago and the stuff in the fridge is set, the canned stuff is not yet but it's still a little warm and I'm confident it's going to turn out (EDIT: All of the jelly set perfectly!). Yield for my (double) batch was 5 pints plus about half a pint from what I skimmed off in foam. My only complaint is this is very very sweet, even for a jelly. I feel like I'm missing out on some subtle flavor due to the high sugar content. I found another (tested, so it's safe for canning) recipe for this that is almost identical except it calls for 3/4 cups sugar, 1/8 headspace and a 5 minute water bath.

After doing some internet research I likened this recipe to a version of Halo-Halo dessert.  Unfortunately, I think that maybe this recipe is not the best or has a mistake in it.  The milk was way, way too much. It was like drinking milk with some shaved ice & corn kernels floating in it. I totally lost the creamed corn & vanilla ice cream flavors & textures to the milk ice.  I don't think even a little bit of milk would have appropriately saved this though.  I also read that the milk ingredient in halo-halo is actually usually sweetened condensed milk or evaporated milk, which I think would make a big big difference!  Sorry, but I will not be making this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing though and introducing me to a new dessert concept that I can experiment with. I will try a commercial made version of halo-halo for more experience with this type of dessert next.

He used less oil and peanuts instead of cashews, though I think cashews definitely would have been better.  Also, snow peas were overdone (again, sorry, not recipe's fault I think) so don't overcook them.  Sesame oil and more garlic might help.  Mild taste, better for a family with kids perhaps.  Sorry I couldn't rate this better, then again note that I didn't make it!  I had second thoughts about rating this at all, but I still think it needed more flavor.  Maybe I will try making this myself again and will rerate.
