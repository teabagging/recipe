Loved the salsa, which was bright and clean and fresh but felt it need just a smidgen of sharpness to highlight the fruit.  Decided on a half teaspoon of minced ginger and a single green onion.  Considered a bit of red onion but now think that would have muddled rather than harmonized and glad that another choice was made.

I did make a few changes in order to use what I had on hand.  1) I only had apple cider vinegar so I used that and 2) I didn't have French dressing, so I used Catalina dressing instead.  3) I never have meat tenderizer around so I omitted that and 4) instead of garlic and onion salt, I used garlic and onion powder because I don't like overly salty food and knew with all of the other ingredients there would already be enough salt.   This was just delicious and my kids were so crazy about it that I'll be making this frequently during grilling season.

We had to sub out soy butter (DS allergies) and they still turned out good. (It's always scary to sub out soy butter in baking recipes)  It's a very good base recipe. It's airy and has a gentle crispness to it. I took the base recipe and divided it into thirds. One third I tinted green and flavored w/ mint extract. I rolled it out, and covered it with 1/3 of regular dough. Rolled it up into a log  and then cut into slices, to look like a green and white spiral. We topped some of the spiral cookies with crushed spearmint candies, some with a mix of crushed candies and green sugar, and some left plain.  We took the last third of the dough and used a cookie scoop.  Dipped the top into colored sugar for half, the other half of that batch we dipped the top in the little round parel things in red and green.  This was a great cookie recipe that allowed me a wide variety of cookies with ease.

Plenty of sugar gets coated on the top of the cookie and little or none is on the cookie sheet. Makes perfectly round cookies very uniform in size.

The recipe works for cookie pizzas, fancy iced, or just plain out of the oven...these are just that good! I was happy to see them here. Watch your measurements. For those of you that find them dry, you are not sifting or lightening your flour before adding or perhaps your home is dry. Flour varies in density. Eggs also can be the culprit if you didnt have the correct size on hand. Try adding a few tablespoons of a beaten one. For those that found them greasy, real butter MUST be used and is non negotiable. These are Fabulous!

I think if I make this again, I may pan cook the chicken, add the spices, peppers, shallots, and artichoke. Then deglaze with the wine, then add the ham, and top with the bernaise sauce.

Or How to please a picky veal eater.  Boy, did I change proportions: to feed 2, I used half the given ingredient amounts through the veal (and had leftover breading mix), then, because I cooked half my veal in one 12 skillet and half in my Le Creuset 6-1/2-qt dutch oven to let each slice of veal cutlet claim its own space in the skillet,  I used the full recipe amounts for the sauce in each pot.  That's right: I quadrupled the amount of sauce for the amount of veal; that was very, very wise on my part.  We still need to work on the amount of cooking time, as our veal was overcooked by my standards; however, the recipe allows one to put all simmering ingredients in one bowl in advance, which means DH can cook this for me on my birthday for a Veal Lover's Birthday meal.  In my first attempt I used pre-minced garlic, which was a pain to remove from the pan and the browned veal.  In my second attempt, I used granulated garlic.  Next time, I would use 1 garlic clove, as the recipe requested; that can't be too difficult to remove, can it?

I think I have found my favorite way to eat quinoa. I contacted the chef because my first attempt went a little off due to the amount of liquid needed (according to WW it's actually 150 ml water and 30 ml milk). My first attempt went something like this: 500 ml water, 300 ml 1% milk and a simmer of about 45 minutes. It never got more firm than a soup, but the flavor was divine (and the grain had a wonderful creaminess from the long simmer time). My 2nd attempt was with 150 ml water, 30 ml 1% milk and a 15-minute simmer time. This time the grain came together like oatmeal. It had a pleasant chewiness and the butterscotch flavor was fantastic. I'm think in the future I'll mix it up with the amount of time I simmer (depending on the level of creaminess I want--or how long I'm willing to stand over the stovetop and stir!

My husband was the one that followed the recipe this time, not me, and he had a little trouble getting the steps to match what he was actually looking at as the dish came together. I'm not sure if he was just trying to be too literal or if the recipe could use some tweaking, but the result ended up a little bit overcooked.
