The yield is also off - you won't get more than 1 1/2 cups of sauce/chutney from the recipe as written. I loved that the apple flavor really came through, though, and will likely use this again, but with the variations I used today in order to turn it into a truer barbecue sauce: omit the brown sugar (the apple butter is plenty sweet), add 4 ounces tomato paste, 6 ounces water, additional salt to taste, and at least another 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar.

My husband loves spicy foods, typically Mexican, so I thought Id give this a try.  I did do quite a few modifications.  The original recipe looked a bit bland (confirmed so by one of the other reviewers).  So I spiced it up a bit.  First, during the browning of the beef (Step 1), I added ? cup chopped onion, 1 can (drained) of black beans, and 1 small can (drained and chopped) green chilies (there were about 3 whole chilies).  Of course, I then drained the beef mixture, to get rid of the excess fat.  Then, during Step 2, I did it a bit differently.  I mixed together the ? cup of milk and the condensed soup.  Then, I added some Chile Powder and a little bit of hot sauce (you should do this to taste, depending how spicy you like it) to the soup/milk mixture.  I added that to the beef mixture.  Then, I followed the recipe as is (adding the salsa, tortillas, ? the cheese, etc).  This was a wonderful dish.  My hubby confirmed by going back for seconds!

but having never known when a vegetable was going to be ripe before i figured i was on a roll and decided to go for it.\\n\\nto serve with my never-before-tried-fritters, i decided to make a cr√®me fra√Æche-lime-cayenne dipping sauce.  so i made fresh cr√®me fra√Æche, and used it as a base not only for this dip, but for a tia maria sauce to go with the flourless chocolate cake i made for dessert (another never-before made item, but with the recipe from cook's illustrated it was the only thing i wasn't making up as i went along).\\n\\nthe result of the fritters was that i got to taste the test fritter, then had to dive across the couch before the last one was devoured in order to have a second.\\n\\nthe one evolution in the recipe is the change from cayenne to chipotle in the dip.  i like the smokiness, and it gives a rough edge to something very smooth - i am all about contrast.  feel free to use whatever chile or combination thereof that you like best.  this dip is easy and stands on it's own at a party for anything you want to dip into it.  i have also made it with vegan sour cream with great results.\\n\\nthe name alligator claws comes from an alternate name for the avocado: the alligator pear, as well as the fact that the wedges of avocado look like claws.\\n\\n(for those not familiar with the name alligator pear, it derives from both the tough, textured exterior - reminiscent of an alligator's hide, and the fact that you really can't eat one until it softens - just like a pear.)\\n\\nalligator claws are also a great name to call them if you have kids who either won't eat anything that sounds weird and you want to keep them to yourself, or - if you want your kids to eat them - if you have kids who'll only eat things that will gross other people out.\\n\\nif you are preparing these for kids (and i recommend you do whatever name you choose to call them), protect their palates and tone down the heat of the sauce.  maybe skip the chiles altogether and put in just a hint of finely ground pepper (white pepper won't look like black specks throughout the dip - i'm normally not that fussy, but it's something kids will notice).\\n\\nallow half an avocado per person.  this is so rich that more is too much.\\n\\nnote:\\nyou can easily cut the recipe in half, all the batter is is a one-to-one mix of flour & water (someone has suggested trying tempura batter which comes in a mix at many supermarkets - i tend to be a from-scratch kind of guy.  or do i just mean itchy?).\\n\\nenjoy.\\n\\n-- text by michael david winter, aka the poker roach","ingredients":"creme fraiche', 'lime, zest of', 'lime, juice of', 'ground chipotle chile pepper', 'flour', 'water', 'hass avocadoes', 'olive oil', 'salt'","review":"I followed the recipe exactly and I found it to be gross..

If you like peaches, oatmeal and ginger the combination is a sure winner however you prepare it :)  (Provided it's sweet! - honey sound like a wonderful idea!)  My variants were to empty the canned Peaches which were in syrup into a sieve and rinse them in water, then use part of the tin (fridged the rest) I squished a few segments (enough to put on top of the porridge) through my fingers into a pot to make a rough puree.  Also, I don't have any candied ginger  (I wish!) so I used 1/2 tsp ground ginger in the porridge with 1/4 to 1/3 tsp caraway seeds though I was dubious about them - they were great together!  I used a generous tsp plain/natural yoghurt and sprinkled sweetener across the top of the porridge with yoghurt on top then added the peach puree over the yoghurt, and sprinkled a bit more ground ginger for good measure (a bit too good a measure I think!).  I wonder if real Ambrosia could be better than this ! :) Soft Brown sugar over the tops sounds a heavenly idea too! Thanks for the excellent recipe suggestion.
