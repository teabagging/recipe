Serve pizzas with dipping sauce. To make the dipping sauce, mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and chile pepper in a sealable container. Seal, and shake until well blended.

Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the pork cubes are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Bring the rice and 4 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside. Once the pork is tender, remove from the saucepan with a slotted spoon and allow to cool a bit. While the pork is cooling, stir the green onion, chopped onion, celery, bell pepper, parsley, cilantro, and garlic into the simmering pork broth. Season with salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the onion is tender. Meanwhile, grind the meat using the coarse plate of a meat grinder. Stir the ground meat into the vegetable mixture, and cook, stirring frequently until the water has nearly evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cooked rice, and set aside to cool. While the meat mixture is cooling, rinse the sausage casings inside and out with plenty of warm water. Keep the casings in a bowl of warm water until ready to stuff. Once the sausage mixture is cool enough to handle, stuff into the prepared casings using a sausage stuffer. Prick the sausage with a needle every 4 to 6 inches. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to keep the water at a very gentle simmer. Add the sausage and cook gently until the sausage is hot on the inside, firm to the touch, and has plumped, about 5 minutes.

Place chicken, vermouth, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and tarragon into a large resealable plastic bag. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 6 hours, or overnight.

Pour 1/2 cup of the marinade into the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink","reviews":"This chicken indeed has an unusual flavor, but the tarragon is the main component of the taste, after the salt.  The amount of lemon pepper is the culprit, I believe, for the excess saltiness in the flavor, especially since the marinade liquid cooks down and contentrates.  I made this recipe exactly as directed, and it does yield nicely colored BLSL chicken.  I made it because I had some vermouth, and I was curious to know how it would do in cooking.  The vermouth flavor was there, but in spite of the amount, it did not overpower the other flavors.  I would recommend using ground black pepper, lemon zest and salt, as a replacement for the lemon pepper, in order to control the saltiness of the dish.'"},{"name":"Caribbean Meat Pockets","rate":"3.454545498","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/464363.jpg","ingredients":"Dough: all-purpose flour curry powder salt vegetable shortening egg water Filling: vegetable oil onion green onions garlic chopped pickled jalapeno peppers ground beef dried thyme curry powder salt ground black pepper water bread crumbs","cooking":" Prep 40 m Cook 1 h 5 m Ready In 1 h 45 m Whisk together the flour, 1 tablespoon curry powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt in a mixing bowl.
