For me it works best on a more thinly cut french fry like that which McDonald's has and spread them out on a cookie sheet so that no fry overlaps another.  I cook them a little longer in the oven than what the recipe states and I leave the skins on for the vitamin/mineral content they supposedly add,  but that's the only thing I had to change.  The salt content in these is perfect for my tastes but for someone that does not like salt as much myself I would recommend lowering the salt used by maybe a quarter or half.  Boiling the fries in the salt water is what really makes this recipe shine.  They cook crisp on the outside and soft in the middle, unlike most the other healthy fry recipes Ive found.  Soooo yummy and as long as you are accounting for the calories, these are just fine for most of you dieters out there.  I never feel full without some carbs and am trying to lose about 10 lbs of belly fat right now so these fit the bill perfectly because they actually fill me up so Im not snacking all night.

What a difference in the taste of the tea, after it sets for an hour. Otherwise the tea is a bit weak in flavor if it's just steep for 10 minutes.

I struggled  somewhat with the flavors in the sauce as I found that 6 cardamon pods where too many and overwhelmed the other flavors, so to correct this I strained the sauce to be able to remove the cardamon pieces.   I also softened the flavors in the sauce by adding extra coconut milk, a little water and about a tsp. of sugar, otherwise I found it to be too sharp. Though the recipe didn't instruct to remove the outer cardamon pod, I did so because I believe they wouldn't cook through and would be woody.  Overall this is a nice dish, though I had to tweak the sauce to smooth-out flavors.  On it's own these are great as a main and side-dish.
