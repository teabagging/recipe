The deli meat was very simple to prepare, but I think next time I'd just as soon use Steak-ums (much cheaper, similar result).  All in all, we liked it.

Alan has presented us a very tasty roast beef sandwich.  He is correct that most places around the country don&#039;t get it right. I really liked the addition of garlic.  I don&#039;t particularly like the peppers in the sandwich, however.  Also, I don&#039;t agree with the author that it is authentic Philly.  He is correct that Cheez Whiz could not have been used before the early 1950&#039;s when it was introduced, so I don&#039;t know what was used when the author was a child.  Pat&#039;s King of Steaks has been around since 1930 and has the best Philly Cheesesteaks, in my opinion.  That&#039;s where I have gone whenever I was in Philadelphia, dating back to the early &#039;70s.  They have always used Cheez Whiz when I visited.  I don&#039;t know what they used before the &#039;50&#039;s, but Velveeta, a similar product, has been around since before 1920, so maybe it was the topping of choice at that time.  Pat&#039;s does offer other cheeses besides Cheez Whiz, but the classic &quot;wit&quot; or &quot;wit out&quot; (with/without onions) includes Cheese Wiz.  I will ask the old-timers at Pat&#039;s if they remember what was once used.  Also, regarding some other recipes, calling a sandwich with mushrooms a &quot;Philly&quot; is like calling chicken wings with barbecue sauce &quot;Buffalo.&quot;  And Alan, did you actually suggest ketchup or marinara as an option?

I originally added only the ingredients listed...but found it needed much more flavoring.  It was much too bland for our palate.  I added a bay leaf, a couple of chicken bouillion cubes, and about 1 teaspoon of Half Sharp Paprika for a little bit of heat, then simmered some more.  In the end it was an excellent soup.  I debated about how many stars to give.  I felt since the veggies just needed some extra boosts to enhance the flavors I would give it 4 stars. (I would have liked to give it 3  1/2 stars, but since it isn&#039;t possible it deserves a 4 rather than a 3.)    IMHO with the added flavor enhancers it is actually closer to a 5.

Healthy, tasty and full of power. It is so easy to make and the outcome is fantastic. I followed the directions, but needn't to add additional flour. The bread needed a little longer in the oven (about 10 minutes). The texture of the bread fluffily, crumbly and still moist. The taste was great. I used a 5-grain mixture of wheat, barley, oat, rye and spelt. And the spelt adds a nice nutty flavour. Instead of whole wheat flour I used whole spelt flour (which have the same baking characteristics) to support the nutty flavour. I would use salt in this bread. Salt enhances also the sweet notes from the sugar and honey. At last I have tried it with different spreads from my favorite jam, peanut butter, fresh cheese with fresh herbs and I tried it also on its own. It is great in taste with any of these. I will keep it in my files for a fast and easy to make bread, which is healthy and so tasty.

Instead of the chard, I used the musroom duxelles from my recipe #457210 (that I had previously frozen)...and used gruyere cheese as fontina was not available.  Once the mushrooms had thawed out, I used some of the mushroom liquid and mixed it in with some homemade chicken broth for more of an earthier taste!   I made this dish up ahead of time and took it over to my girlfriend's place and finished off the cooking there.  Do watch what you are paring this dish with as it is really rich in taste...a little serving does go a long way.  We had this served with pork tenderloin, baby potatoes and garden salad!  As for the taste, it was absolutely nummy goodness.  Keep in mind, 4 cups of liquid would equal the amount you would need for a onion soup.  I used 3 cups and could possible have used a bit less.

The final product, however, wasn't quite as good. We liked them ok, but they weren't exceptional. You could definitely taste the Andes and the texture was great - nice and soft and chewy - but there was just something missing, I think. As far as cooking specifications, I couldn't find the baking chips so I used 2 and a half of the approximately 5 oz. packages of candy, quartering each piece before mixing them in. I had no idea how much dough 1 oz. was, so I just guessed and must have been pretty close because I got almost 4 dozen cookies. I also found the dough to be a bit sticky and difficult to work with, especially straight out of the refridgerator. These cookies took a little longer to cook than I'd been expecting - at least 10 minutes - and I must warn you that these are the kind of cookie that don't look done when they're actually done.
