My other daughter only ate the chicken because she doesn't care for stuffing...but don't go by her, she's a typical teenager! It was delicious.  There was a lot of liquid, soup and such, compared to the stuffing I think I may add a bit more stuffing next time.  Also I didn't have the 6-8 hrs. to cook this, so I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used frozen chicken and cooked it on high for 3.5 hrs.  I think that may be why my swiss cheese melted into my soup.  It gave the soup a cheesey delicious flavor though.  Next time I will use thawed chicken and use the 6-8 hrs on low and see what is different. My crockpot is round and it is quite big but I still had to stack a little of the chicken on top of each other, that may be another reason why things slid off into the soup.

So, I'll surely be omitting the green chilli and cutting on the black pepper also by half of the quantity mentioned here. I used about a tsp. of salt for this. We had this with low-fat plain yoghurt and rotis(Indian flatbreads). This also goes well when stuffed in between bread slices or also with pao(a fat puffed up kind of bread).

Followed the recipe exactly with a few minor subs- I used steamed russets instead of new potatoes (it's all I had on-hand, and I really wanted to make this!) and added a tsp of dried mint with the other spices rather than fresh (although I'm sure fresh would be spectacular).  The spice blend is extremely tasty- I thought the caraway was a really interesing unusual addition.  As far as heat goes, I used 1 large thai pepper and only 1/2 tsp cayenne.  Thanks to you and your great recipes, we are developing a taste for spicy food, but we're not quite iron-tongued like you yet!  This comes together so quickly.

Vanilla is easy - you just toast a bean until it's dry and then stick it in a coffee/spice grinder.

Wipe out your grinder with a dry paper towel between grinds if you're worried about flavor transfer, but since they are all going in the mix together, it doesn't really matter much here. You can really save $$$ by making some of the &quot;weird&quot; spices you don't usually see in ground form. If you are worried about cost on William Sanoma vanilla beans, just make sure you get Tahitian ones - different regions taste different so at least get the right country.
