It seemed as soon as the sugar started to melt, it boiled. I would suggest using a stand mixer to get a slow steady stream into the bowl. My dough ended up with some clumps of sugar rocks (probably because I boiled it!) that I was really worried about. Once the cake cook, the rocks melted and they were undetectable! I also didn't put enough flour on my first parchment paper so the dough circle stuck a bit. I was more generous later, which worked to keep the dough from sticking, just make sure to dust the flour off. It takes a LOT of sour cream so be ready for that!

For pints, use one tablespoon bottled lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon citric acid. Acid can be added directly to the jars before filling with product. Add sugar to offset acid taste, if desired.

I made it for 3 of my friends and we all enjoyed it. I baked mine in a casserole dish for 55 mins and kept it covered with aluminum foil for the first 40 mins so that the cheese wouldn't burn.

It turned out amazing!  The entire family loved it.  Even my picky 7 year old son ate two helpings of it.  I made my own sauce from scratch and used uncooked wheat noodles.  I also cut the mushrooms into smaller pieces and saut&eacute;ed with them a little olive oil and garlic.  I put the saut&eacute;ed mushrooms on a paper towel while I prepared the other items to ensure there was not too much liquid.  I also squeezed out the liquid from the spinach with paper towels.  Everything else was identical to what the recipe called for.  I didn?t measure the amount of sauce on each layer, just put on what I typically do for my usual lasagna.  Once it was all assembled I covered it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.  Monday night my 16 year old son took it out of the fridge, put aluminum foil on top and we cooked it until the cheese looked melted and bubbly.  I was shocked when the noodles were perfectly cooked AND the lasagna was not runny in the least bit.  I was hugely impressed with the recipe and everyone in the family stated they would definitely eat it again.  My 16 year old even said he didn?t even realize there was no meat in it.  Any recipe that can impress my husband and all three of my kids is a keeper without a doubt!

I did follow Birdinhand's suggestions and I browned a small onion and then added the mushrooms to the saute pan and saute'ed them with the onions, as well. I added the minced garlic to the sauce along with the oregano. Then I remembered that the flavor I associate with &quot;lasagna&quot; is fennel, and I added about a half teaspoon of ground fennel to the sauce, too. Oh, did that make the difference! My box of whole wheat pasta had 8 lasagna noodles and I used them all, so I had a couple of noodles going perpendicular to the rest at the bottom of my casserole dish. I had two cups of zucchini, so I cut back the spinach to one 10 oz box and kept the sauce to one quart since zucchini is so juicy. I do not like a sloppy lasagna. I also ended up with about a cup of carrots when I grated two of them, and used it all. I also used all of my two packages of mozzarella, which was four cups. I probably used about a cup of grated parm, too. I probably don't need to point this out by now, but just in case this is the first of its reviews you are reading, this recipe is very flexible!

I think the sauce is very elegant and I might want to use it over a more simply prepared fish so that it's flavors could be better appreciated.
