I just loved it and will make it often perhaps over time adding different herbs or spices to complement the rest of the meal.  My one comment, which is more a reader issue is that the amount of liquid should be used at the lesser amount. I used a full cup because that is typical for this grain.  However the veggies give off lots of liquid which meant the final dish was a bit mushy and there was still small polls of liquid at the end of the cooking & sitting time. Note this did not stop us frm enjoying this side with grilled chicken.  I'm planning to make this again with 3/4 or even 2/3 cupof broth and will update my review.  Excellent side.

My husband called it homemade Wonder Bread.  The texture of the crumb is nice, but the crust is far too soft.  It needs more eggs.<br/><br/>It's a very time-consuming recipe.  FOUR rises?  I can't even imagine the work this would be if it were made by hand.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with the way the recipe is written.  I assume that everyone who considers making it will read the instructions through first, and realize that you don't add ALL the ingredients to the bread machine, as the first direction states.  It would be a nuisance trying to extract the egg white, the seeds and the raisins.  But adding the ingredients in the order listed is not correct for any bread machine.  Some call for adding the liquid ingredients, and then the dry ones; for others, it's the other way around.  None are mixed up like this.  It's not that important, unless you're using a delay cycle, but it's a frustrating direction.<br/>The ingredient list mentions poppy seeds; the directions mention sesame seeds.  This brings up the question:  Are you supposed to put poppy seeds into the bread, and then top it with sesame seeds, or are they both for topping, and you make your choice?<br/><br/>325? is far too cool an oven for bread.  I baked mine at 375? for the required time, and it was still underdone (in an accurate oven).  <br/><br/>It's not awful.  It's a very sweet, light bread.  It makes good toast.

Just like you in the beginning, I also cannot believe how easy it is to make gherkins!  Yes, I still call them gherkins because I grew up calling them that... pickles to me are pickled onions!  These are made weekly in my home and because the turnover is so fast, I don't even bother with a sterilized jar anymore... they go straight into their own tupperware container and into the fridge.

It is the combination of ingredients which make the winning recipe. The sauce is a wonderful winning combination of a mustard sauce and the falvors for gravad salmon (dill, honey, lemon). And to just warm it and not to cook is best. This will keep all the falvours in the sauce, especially the mustard notes. I jsut made a little change here: I used lime juice instead of lemon. I like the more fruity notes of lime. The sauce is very creamy and well balanced between sweet and tart or spicy and herbal. Cooking the salmon only in white wine is another great idea. The salmon will be moist and will have enough acidity. Basting with wine will keep it moist. The fish came out perfect and was a real beauty on the plate with the sauce on the side and some capers (I have missed to add them in the photos). As a side I have made ovenbaked potato slices.

(I made minor changes which did not affect the rest of the recipe:  2 parts milk 1 part whipping cream, as I discovered I was low on milk, after I'd started; pouring through a sieve directly into the ramekins, to save dirtying a bowl; and experimenting with cinnamon in the second half of the custard batch, after I'd poured the first half into half the ramekins--tasty enough!"},{"name":"easy weiner wraps","steps":"run a knife down the middle of each hot dog', 'slice cheese into 4 sections', 'insert 2 sections of cheese into each hot dog', 'spread mustard on hot dog and wrap in lightly moistened egg roll wrapper', 'cook on a drip rack in small pan in your toaster oven at 350 for about 5 to 7 minutes', 'when the wrapper begins to brown slightly , your weiners are done', 'garnish with mustard and sweet relish'","description":"easy to fix...makes a great snack. prepare a batch for your next party, then slice and serve as hors douvres.","ingredients":"fat-free hot dogs', 'egg roll wraps', 'fat free cheese', 'spicy mustard', 'sweet relish'","review":"Rich, crunchy, and buttery with just a hint of chocolate from the jimmies !!

I&#039;ll probably pull it out the next time I make it in favor of paprika.  I also as suggested by other&#039;s halved the salt.  And that worked for me when I put it in the gumbo.  Soups tradtionally have tons of sodium, so the folks that are panicking about the salt can use less if they want.  But I do like this spice recipe, a nice flavor, and you can really tell the freshness of it being newly made.  I would say this is more of a cajun spice than a creole spice.

Your oven, set at 200 degrees, IS a crock pot as long as the food is covered- as it would be in a crock-pot. Go anywhere from 2 1/2 to 4 hours in either appliance and the results will be identical= delicious!<br/><br/>The ONLY reason I'd ever use a second appliance is if I wanted to caramelize the ribs on the grill at the end of cooking, a look and texture unachievable in the crock or oven.

If you make the topping first &amp; add approx 1/3 of it to the meat mixture, that leaves enough topping to generously cover the meatloaf w/a pastry brush at the start &amp; brush more of it atop the meatloaf 2 more times as it cooks. This tasty meatloaf will definitely encore at our dining table w/the chgs mentioned.
