We really loved this recipe!!!  I did make a few modifications, partly due to availability of ingredients, partly due to preference, which I'll list here.  Instead of stirfrying the ginger and garlic with the veg, I added it to the stirfry sauce (which totally kicked butt!!), which I doubled, because I like it saucy!  Truth be told, though, it would have been fine as is.  I chose to add the ginger and garlic to the sauce because I felt they would burn/overcook or just loose their intensity if fried with the veg.  And I suppose also because I'm a creature of habit, and that's how I tend to make most stirfry sauces.  For the mushrooms, the recipe didn't stipulate which kind, so I used half button, and half cremini.  Instead of green beans, I used yellow, and supplimented them with snow peas, and also added some red pepper for colour.  Lastly, instead of peas, I used edname beans (what I had on hand).  Oh - and I'd picked up tofu for this recipe earlier in the week, completely forgetting that it called for egg as the protein!  So, I used tofu - but will use egg next time.  And not only will there be a next time, but I'm passing this gem on to my sister, who was mentioning to me today that she is in a bit of a cooking rut - and this recipe, with the change in protein (by this I mean the egg, their not new to tofu), and the succulent and yet simple sauce, definately fits the bill.

I used 2 T-Bone steaks & 2 London Broil steaks (tenderized them by poking with a fork then sprinkled with meat tenderizer) and sprinkled a tad more flour on top after browning (for thicker gravy), 4 (14oz.) cans of beef broth, 1/3 cup of Brandy, 6 tablespooons of Worcestershire sauce, 1 envelope of Onion Soup mix (per Barb's suggestion), 2 large onions and sauteed an 8oz. container of fresh mushrooms in Garlic Butter and Brandy. The steak, onions and mushrooms smelled sooooo gooood while cooking and were so fork tender that I had to take the London Broil out with a spatula!! The T-Bones were falling off & away from the bone and I had so much rich, thick mushroom & onion gravy!!

I used a Vidalia onion for this, too (I had way too many Vidalias lying around to justify purchasing a red onion for this). I tried it without the chicken first, but then decided to add some leftover grilled chicken breast for protein. I made this last night and tossed the veggies with the dressing right away, but kept the toasted bread and chicken separate until right before I wanted to eat it. I think I liked it better after it had a chance to chill for a while (and for the flavors to meld). Of course, that isn't saying much, since I loved it right away, too lol.

The bread is delicious with a tight cell but it is NOT dense.  If you are looking for a soft white bread with a moist crumb without a lot of irregular openings, then this recipe produces with minimal effort.\\n\\nI wanted a softer crust so I used half milk and half water (105 degrees F).  I also brushed the tops with butter before baking to help with the soft top.  \\n\\nI also wanted a light fluffy texture (like store bought) so I added a whole egg between steps 3 and 4. \\n\\nI used sugar instead of honey and only used 2/8 (in addition to the the 6 cups) of additional flour in the kneeding process to make up for the lost moisture from the honey that I omitted (I didn't have any). But, I prefer honey and using honey vs. sugar does help the bread from spoiling as quickly. \\n\\nI created a humid warm environment by heating a 1 cup measure full of water until 1 minute  in my microwave. Then, I stuck my bowl of dough in the microwave with the cup still in there...making sure the plastic wrap is touching the dough anywhere it stood above the bottom of the bowl WITH extra wrap to allow for the rising.  Otherwise the uneven heat source could create a hardened spot in the dough closest to the measure cup.  I always use this method for raising dough in the winter because my house is drafty.\\n\\nI cooked all loaves at once on the middle rack for 20 minutes and they were all done (internal temp was 190 deg. F) evenly.  I did not have to tent with foil.  They all sliced beautifully and this bread is just delicious and very fragrant. \\n\\nThe difference in the pans:\\n\\n1. Dark nonstick metal produced a better flavor than the stoneware did but the sides and bottom were not as beautifully colored. Also, crust on top was a little softer. There was a small amount of liquid in the bottom when I took the loaf from the pan. This was likely responsible for the difference in all around crust.\\n2.  Stoneware produced a better looking loaf with a more even loft. The sides and bottom were gorgeous.  The crust was a little crispier while still soft.  The flavor was not as good for some reason.\\n\\nSo, it seems...flavor vs. attractiveness is the deciding factor.\\n\\nThank you for posting!  -Caryn"},{"name":"inside out peanut butter cookie sandwiches","steps":"preheat oven to 350f', 'combine morsels in small bowl , set aside', 'combine flour , baking soda and salt in another small bowl', 'beat butter , peanut butter , granulated sugar , brown sugar and vanilla extract in large mixer bowl until creamy', 'beat in egg', 'gradually beat in flour mixture', 'stir in 1 cup morsel mixture', 'drop dough by rounded tablespoon onto ungreased baking sheets', 'press down slightly', 'bake for 10 to 13 minutes or until golden brown', 'cool on baking sheets on wire racks for 2 minutes', 'remove to wire racks to cool completely', 'spread peanut butter frosting and filling on bottom side of one cookie', 'place bottom side of a second cookie over frosting creating a cookie sandwich', 'press down slightly', 'frost top of cookie sandwich and sprinkle with a few morsels', 'repeat with remaining cookies and frosting', 'peanut butter frosting and filling:', 'combine 1 1 / 4 cups prepared vanilla frosting and 1 / 4 cup creamy or chunky peanut butter in small bowl'","description":"a fun blend of peanut butter cookies and frosting topped with holiday morsels! this sandwich cookie is perfect to make for a holiday cookie exchange.","ingredients":"nestle swirled holiday morsels', 'nestl toll house semi-sweet chocolate morsels', 'all-purpose flour', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'butter', 'creamy peanut butter', 'granulated sugar', 'brown sugar', 'vanilla extract', 'egg', 'vanilla frosting'","review":"Yummy!!!!

I made this recipe yesterday by halving for 1 loaf. My bread machine mixed the dough, I used half Better For Bread/half wheat flour (3 cups total). I used sugar (had no honey) and regular butter (had no unsalted). About the salt, 1 tablespoon seemed like a bit much (for this size loaf I typically add 1-1/2 tsp) so I used 1 teaspoon because of the salted butter. I used 2 tablespoons of butter for the dough. As others suggested I bakes for 25 minutes @ 400 degrees. Lately I've been experimenting with my Pyrex Bake-A-Round (I acquired it without directions). The loaf turned out w/ a beautiful honey-brown color crust. The crust was not soft - more crunchy, actually - but it sliced perfectly. The interior was excellent. The texture was ideal for sandwiches. It was flavorful, quite delicious! My husband loved it. Great recipe. I'll look forward to making this again and again.

The instructions were really clear, and I like that you pointed out that it's still delicious even if it's not pretty.  The only part I had trouble with was cutting the rolls.  I probably need to sharpen my good knife.  My husband said that the sushi chefs leave the plastic wrap on top of the roll while cutting, and that actually helped quite a bit.

I cut this down to two portions (since I have two kids) but halfway though we got extra kids over to play so I quickly abandoned the idea of letting them all in the kitchen to decorate the eggs, too many kids not nearly enough eggs or space. There was still a LOT of dough... even for the two serves and if I understood the instructions correctly I should have divided and rolled ALL of it into long ropes and made cirles of it on the tray, but then it says cut 2 strips of pastry in step 6... but doesn't mention where that pasrty is to come from. Confused? I sure was... I ended up diving the pastry in half and made half into the long ropes and half into the X around the egg... and I can only hope that my interpretation is even remotely connected to how this is supposed to look like !LOL.\\nAlso the instruction place a boiled egg at *both* ends where the dough meets... um , I had 2 long ropes,  each in a circle and 2 boiled eggs, did I need 4 boiled eggs to have one at each end of each rope circle\\nI did find the dough very crumbly and dry and the end baked result was rather dry as well.
