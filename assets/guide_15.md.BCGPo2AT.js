I have been making this for years, first saw it in Bon Appetit magazine, Nov. 1999 issue,Rick Rodgers is the chef. Although it is great just the way it is, here are some of the changes I have made through out the years: Increase the amount of cheeses; the Parmesan I increase to 3/4 cup. Add a touch of garlic powder. Instead of heating the milk to a simmer on the stovetop, I put the milk in a large pyrex measuring cup and heat it in the microwave. I also use half of the butter called for as the cheeses make it very rich already. One thing I love about it is that you can make it and bake it beforehand. Then stick it in the frig. Then 45 minutes before serving it, put it in the oven uncovered. This is truly a keeper.

I quartered this recipe and made 1 mini springform and 1 mini bundt cake. I checked on them after 20 minutes (without opening oven door) and they had risen up out of the pan. I let them bake for another 20 minutes and saw that they had fallen. :( We took the bundt pan one out of the pan and ate it right from the oven and it was sooo delicious! I continued as directed with the one in the mini springform pan. For the glaze, I microwaved the morsels then stirred in some melted 'fresh-from-the-farm' homemade butter (since this is made with fresh cream) and we got a wonderful glaze! So although the cakes had fallen and they had a cookie crunch texture on the edges and a dreamy truffley center, the taste of this cake is really good.

I served this for a Greek dinner party with FlemishMinx' Greek Chicken and Potatoes (recipe #93596), Mean Chef's Tzatziki (recipe #51983) and lots of pita bread. I eliminated the potatoes and increased the zucchini by 2X because I already had potatoes in one dish. The myzithra cheese tended to burn easily so will try kefalograviera or parmesan next time. I agree with Syrah that the recipe call for too much oil. Perhaps try cutting to 1/2 cup. I used a 9x13 baking dish filled to overflowing. Thankfully, it does cook down as the recipe says. The house smelled WONDERFUL while this was cooking.

I have to have my meat! However we tried this one for dinner last night and I think it's the first time ever I have had just a veggie and felt satisfied. I managed to find Myzithra cheese at Safeway!

(I dona?t really use salt in my cooking, so I am sure the cheese would be fine for most people) I didna?t have zucchini in the house, when I placed my grocery delivery they brought me yellow crooked neck squash instead of zucchini so I used it. I imagine this recipe would have been 5 stars if I had used zucchini, but it was only 4 stars the way I did it SO I am giving it 5 :-) I also only had one large tomato so I sliced it and peeled it as directed then put about  cup yellow cherry tomatoes to make up the difference. I thought while making it that it would be good with carrots but I decided not to put them in, next time I will I think it would have added a wonderful flavor. It JUST fit in a 13x9 pan and was rather difficult to a?tossa? however after about an hour it cooked down and fit perfectly.

Quite accurate, while most Mexican people don't add tomatoes to their caldo, there are some people out there who do.  It really depends what region from Mexico you're from.  I would suggest some minor changes to improve the flavor, like instead of using garlic powder, try some fresh minced garlic.  I also mince my onion instead of quarters, that's purely to trick the people in my household who don't like onions.  I add them early along with a handful of fresh cilantro in order to flavor the broth.  I don't use celery, mainly because I don't like it :P  I guess I could always mince it but I rather not, heh heh heh.  I use chayote squash, if you can find it where you live and use small potatoes whole, instead of cutting the big potatoes to avoid a starchy soup.  I don't like cabbage either.  In some Mexican regions, people add plantain bananas to the soup also.  It's really a very versatile soup, for you to add your veggies that are about to go expire.  I sometimes add mushrooms too, just personal preference, nothing authentic about that.  If you like the flavor, garnish with diced onions and fresh cilantro.

Very similar to our family recipe, except for a little tweeking of my own: I like to use Beef Shank meat and Beef Bones with BONE MARROW still in them to give the soup a more delicious taste. I wash the meat and bones really good before I use them. I also prefer to peel my carrots and my potatoes. I like to add 1 can of garbanzo beans and fresh green beans too. FIRST, I wash the meat and bones and put these in a large pot filled with cool water together with 5 peeled garlic cloves and salt. This cooks covered at rapid boil for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (depending on the amount of meat). During the cooking time of the meat I check for any foam that rises to the top and remove it. After 1/12 hrs. to 2 hours of rapid boiling, I check the meat for tenderness and remove the garlic. Then I add 1/2 med onion, 3 celery sticks cut-up, and the veggies: 3 peeled and cut-up carrots, 3 corns cut in 1/2, 4 med peeled russet potatoes cut in half, 1/2 can garbanzo beans, and a small bunch of fresh green beans. I cover and bring it to a rapid boil again and cook for 15 minutes. After 15 min. I check if the soup needs more salt, I add more if necessary. Finally I add the cabbage 1/2 a head cut in quarters, 3 cut-up zucchini, and 3 sprigs of cilantro. I cover and bring it to a rapid boil again and cook it for another 10 minutes. It should be done now. When all is done, I serve my soup in a bowl and add some minced chives, minced cilantro, a little bit of minced serrano chile, and some squeezed lime juice.

The next morning let it come to room temp, it still rose nicely (during this time I visited the sourdough thread just to report on what had happened with a questionable response to possible viability) I then shaped into round flat bread and allowed to raise again.  As another error - forgot to slash, don't know what's been going on with my mind - maybe it's because DH is heading overseas again!!  Placed all four rounds into the oven and sprayed as directed.  When it came out they were lovely, puffed just right for what I was wanting and a great sourdough flavor.  So even with my errors, this still worked awesome.
