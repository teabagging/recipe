I saute 5-8 diced carrots and 4-6 diced celery stalks and use about 2/3 cup rice (so my picky eater will eat LOTS of veggies and not so much rice), and the recipe still works out great.

I used the prescribed amt of garlic, ginger & oil, but started with 1/4 cup soy sauce & found that ample for the marinade. I also amended the prep slightly. Honey is *very* thick here & I am not very good at getting a uniform outcome w/a *roll in this & then roll in that* method, so I warmed the honey in my microwave for easy mixing & combined it w/the brown sugar + sesame seeds. Then I used my pastry brush to uniformly apply the mixture to the tenderloin surfaces. The meat was flavourful & fork-tender, but I cooked it too long at the full 30 min (my bad) & will reduce that to 20-25 min next time.

My first few bites, I kept checking to make sure the meat was actually thoroughly cooked because it was so tender!

Served with rice (cooked with about 1/2 t of the sesame oil), and orange pepper oven roasted in olive oil and light seasoning (Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute, if you must know).

I only had about 1 hour for the chocolate-scotch topping to firm up so I could cut them (was taking them to a work potluck), so I put them in the fridge while I got ready for work. Ack! When I went to cut them, I actually needed a MEAT CLEAVER to do the job! Luckily, once the bars warmed back up again, they softened back into cereal treats instead of jawbreakers, LOL. They were very tasty either way, just super-hard to chew when cold. They were snapped right up once they softened.

Each ingredient add its individual flavor and you can clearly distinct them from each other. But as a whole the build up a new world of flavors. Bell peppers and parmesan built the fundament. Then there are the shrimps togehter with the feta cheese and onions, delicious. The tomatoes (sweet through the sugar) with fresh basil and the bread (an all time favorite). Kalmata olives, garlic and parsley as little highlights in between. All flavors will be hold together by the bread and the wonderful dressing. Different textures and the combination of such different flavors makes this recipe a great experience. Every bite is  different. Try the creamy feta cheese with the sweetness of the bell peppers or the different textures of buttered bread, shrimps and tomatoes. And so on and on.

I did omit the sunflower seeds and instead used a combination of craisins and raisins.

The cookie part is so rich and tender and the raspberry jam compliments it perfectly. Delicious! I also think the cookie would be good with just a drizzle of dark chocolate on them. ;) I used white chocolate chips instead of the baking bar since the ingredients were identical and the chips were a lot cheaper. 4 oz is 1/3 cup of chips. I found that it was best to make the indention while they were still on the baking sheet and then transfer them to a cooling rack. When I tried to do it on the rack, the cookie got messed up on the bottom. I tried making the indention before baking and that didn't seem to make any difference since they puffed up while they baked.
