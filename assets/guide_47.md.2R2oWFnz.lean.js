I set it aside in a cake keeper, then frosted it with the chocolate frosting the night before I took it in.) The contrast between the sweet filling and the slightly bittersweet frosting was incredible. I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the buttercream frosting filling, and I garnished the cake with bittersweet chocolate chips instead of the chocolate curls. I find that when spreading this type of frosting, if you dip an offset spatula into hot water and drag it over the frosting, it will give you a beautiful, smooth surface. This is definitely a keeper!!!!! One of my co-workers said it was death by chocolate!

My husband loves lthe emon loaf from a local coffee shop and so I've tried making it for him.  Most recipes taste like a plain pound cake with lemon on top.  This is the first I've found that has a real lemony flavour throughout, without adding fake lemon extract.  The secret I think is the glaze that goes into the cake at the end.  I can't comment on how the cake keeps as it was gone in one day lol!"},{"name":"jamie s christmas jerk ham","steps":"preheat the oven to 180 / 350 degrees / gas 4', 'put the ham in a large roasting pan with all of the poaching ingredients', 'add water until it comes halfway up the side of the pan', 'cover the ham with tinfoil', 'bake for two hours or until pink and cooked through , remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes , remaining covered', 'while your ham poaches add the bay leaves and the dry spices to a food processor with the garlic cloves', 'whizz it to form a paste then add the onions and chillies and whizz again', 'pour in the rum and malt vinegar and keep whizzing while adding the thyme', 'once it has a nice loose consistency the marinade is ready', when the ham has had it's 30 mins out of the oven , transfer it to a roasting tray and let it cool down a bit, while it's still warm , put your hand underneath the skin and gently pull it away from the meat , leaving a bit of the fat underneath attached, 'then with a sharp knife , score the ham by lightly making diagonal cuts across the leg', 'spoon the marinade over the pork and into the scored fat', 'if you want to use your hands to rub it in please wear gloves !', 'you can cover the ham with cling film and chill it overnight if you wish , or cook right away', 'pour a small glass of water into the bottom of the roasting tray and put the ham into the preheated oven for 2 hours', 'try to baste it every 30 mins or so to get it good and dark', 'after the two hours are up , scrape a bit of the marinade off with a spatula ans spoon about 3 / 4 jar of marmalade over it and a good swig of rum on top', 'smear this mixture all over the ham and let it drip down the sides too', 'spoon the juices off the bottom of the pan back over the ham and put it back in the oven for another 30 minutes , basting every 5-7 minutes to build up the crust', when it's lovely and dark , it's done !]","description":"a wonderful detour from the usual christmas glazed ham recipes, courtesy of jamie oliver...but certainly not limited to just the christmas period!! \\ndon't be put off from the seemingly never ending list of ingredients...it's actually very simple, and really delicious.\\ni have actually made just the jerk marinade and used it on a smoked ham,skipping the poaching step and the results were still delicious.\\ntake care prepping the chillies-best to use gloves-don't be afraid to cut back on chillies if you don't like it too hot!!\\nthis is great served salad, jacket potato etc....","ingredients":"ham', 'whole black peppercorn', 'red onion', 'chilies', 'whole cloves', 'celery', 'leek', 'thyme', 'cinnamon stick', 'fresh bay leaves', 'cinnamon', 'allspice', 'clove', 'ground nutmeg', 'sea salt', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'garlic cloves', 'red onions', 'dark rum', 'malt vinegar', 'marmalade', 'golden rum'","review":"Years ago I'd had a great lemon cake and always wanted to find the perfect recipe....I think I just did!!

smaller than typical recipes).  the smaller size works best in my food processor and i find it is the preferred size of my farmer's market customers.  it makes great french toast.  it is also an excellent base recipe for sweet breads (cinnamon raisin swirl, pecan rolls, etc.)  i use a 14 cup cuisinart food processor to make all my breads but the recipe could be adapted to a bread machine,

It thickens up a lot when it cools, so don't be afraid.  It is on the sweet side and would be wonderful on apple salad, cole slaw, or potato salad.  I can see why it would be so good with lobster.  I used it for homemade ranch and I thought it tasted more like a honey mustard dressing than a ranch dressing.  But hubby was thrilled, so that's all that mattered.

The whole family loved it, well, except the four year old, but she doesn't like anything really. :: laugh :::\\nI didn't have a lot of time to marinate the chicken, so I cut it into cubes to marinade and pan fried it. If you want to use the leftover marinade as a sauce, either use less soy, or put something else in it to take the saltiness out. The chicken was WONDERFUL, but the marinade a bit salty when used as a sauce. I still give this five stars because the marinade wasn't meant to be a sauce in the first place :: smile ::::"},{"name":"japanese style curry udon noodles  karei udon","steps":"in a 2 quart saucepan , heat the oil', 'add the flour and cook , stirring for a minute over low heat', 'add the curry powder and cook another minute', 'whisk in the hot vegetable stock all at once: it will thicken almost instantaneously', 'add the soy sauce and syrup and cook until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon', 'cook the udon noodles in a large pot of boiling water', 'when al dente , drain well , rinse and place into 4 large bowls', 'fill each bowl with curry sauce , top with scallions and serve immediately'","description":"i love the idea of the mixture of curry in this traditional udon noodle recipe! if you haven't tried udon noodles: they are a thick noodle used in many asian recipes","ingredients":"oil', 'flour', 'curry powder', 'vegetable stock', 'soy sauce', 'maple syrup', 'udon noodles', 'water', 'scallions'","review":"Tastes great, and pretty simple too.
