You CANNOT replace the roasted garlic with garlic powder or garlic salt or any kind of fresh garlic without totally changing the flavor profile of the dish. Roasted garlic does not taste like fresh garlic, it has a much richer and fuller flavor with none of the after taste or garlic breath.

First, it says to cut the zucchini into strips, and then combine it with other ingredients. I read this as cutting it lengthwise, but then it will not mix well with the tomatoes and onion. You need to either slice or grate the zucchini. Second, it does not say a size casserole dish. I assumed 9 by 13 since that is usually the standard size, but it would fit better in an 8 by 11.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from that, I made several substitutions. To decrease the amount of fat and cholesterol, it halved the cheese and used oats in place of the cracker crumbs and used only one layer instead of having a layer in between. After entering it into nutrition database, this comes out as only 311 calories and 13 grams of fat, in addition to increasing the fiber. I used a red bell pepper because that was what I had on hand, and added 2 cloves of garlic. I am not very fond of chili powder, so I substituted cayenne pepper.

I followed the recipe, using the olive oil, Dijon, dried onions, garlic powder, grape tomatoes, cilantro and orange bell pepper options.

In any event, I cooked mine at 350 F, but on the convection setting. The cookies came out very cake-like with very lightly browned edges and not overly moist, as some have complained about with this recipe. They were light, the perfect amount of moistness, and absolutely delicious. One change I did make at the suggestion of others was to increase the spice. I made a mixture of 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 3/4 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp allspice. I put 2 tsp of the mix into the cookies, and sprinkled about a tsp of it into the icing mix (added at the of cooking the butter and brown sugar). Also, I felt the icing needed a bit more milk, so I added a few more tbsps to make it more spreadable. In terms of the taste of the icing - it is good, but very sweet.

An interesting recipe at first sight, but  after the first mouthful I knew this is a winner. All the different flavors found a counterpart. The lime juice is in contrast to the sweet taste of corn.

I made it for a church potluck last weekend.  Someone made a similar version, without the candy bars and glaze.  Mine was a huge hit!  I used five snack size Almond Joy bars, halved, and five snack size Mounds bars, halved.  Rather than stir the candy into the cake batter, I evenly spaced the halved bars on top of the cake batter in the pan and gently pressed the bars into the batter, barely covering each piece with cake batter.  The glaze is a must have; do not leave it off!  It is like the fudge icing on a chocolate doughnut.  Thanks, Jane, for a fabulous new recipe.  :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.S.  My cake took 55 minutes to be perfectly done.

little', once the water boils , salt well , and put all the cabbage inches it will look like a lot , but don't worry , it will wilt down a lot too, 'cover', 'as soon as the water returns to a boil , count 10 to 15 minutes , and drain', 'reserve', 'as the cabbage is cooking , you can get started on the other vegetables', 'first the carrots', 'peel them and cut them in 1 / 3 of an inch slices',

all the way , but leaving the bottom inch still attached', 'wash them really well , check each leaf on both sides for dirt', 'then chop them 2 / 3 of an inch thick chunks', 'put them in a colander , and separate them , under running water to be safe for dirt', 'reserve', 'now chop some bacon in half inch thick chunks', 'i use about 6-7 slices of bacon , but you can use more if you like', just don't use less , we need both the fat the bacon is going to release , and the flavor as a base for the cabbage, 'just before you actually start cooking the dish , rinse the pot you cooked the cabbage in , put your potatoes in , lukewarm water , cover and put to boil', 'when it boils , add 2 cubes of knorr vegetable bouillon cube , and salt liberally', once it comes to a boil , pre-cook them for 20

the bacon back in the pan and toss everything together until its mixed well', 'push it a little to make room for the 2 sausages , and hide the carrots behind the barrier made by the sausages', 'i use hillshire farm', 'taste the cabbage for salt', 'then cover with 2 cups of beef stock', when i don't have time to make my own , i use kitchen basics beef stock , because as its low in sodium , it allows me to control the salt, 'now peel the potatoes , and nest them well in the cabbage so they can suck up all the flavors', 'if you have extra potatoes you can put the extra ones on top of the

Here's what I didn't like about it: 1. The recipe called for a stock pot. It should have specified a size because I used mine and it huge. Lol 2. It made 3 regular size bowls of soup. I don't see how you can get 8 servings out of this. 5, maybe 6, definitely not 8 unless you're a baby. 3. At the roux part I was not- so- pleasantly surprised that my &quot;roux&quot; looked more like Stove Top Stuffing. It didn't start looking like roux until I added a cup of broth. 4. It's more sweet than spicy. I don't know what made it sweet but I used unsalted butter, regular corn tortillas, and regular half and half. I didn't care for the sweetness at all. You know, it being Poblano soup and all, I was looking for spice. 5. It turned out thick. Like porage. I let it slowly simmer for 7 minutes.

I'd already put in about 2 1/2 cups strong wholemeal flour before I noticed it was brown sugar, not flour so I did the last 1/2 cup as strong white flour.  I fancied honey rather than sugar so used 2 TBLSP honey instead, and only used 1 TBLSP butter to keep the fat low(er).  I used a whole cup of some unsweetened 'Alpen' to use more of it up, and as I didn't think there was enough fruit I added a TBLSP currants.  I added a few more TSPs water as it looked a bit dry with this particular muesli/granola, and as I almost always do a good 1/3 TSP of vitamin C powder.  Notwithstanding my multiple mistakes and the change to honey (which I liked) it tastes great with a little low-fat spread and honey.  Definitely going to make again.  Quite liked the inadvertant wholemeal flour use although I'll probably drop it just 1 cup of wholemeal next time.
