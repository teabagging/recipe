I can understand why some may have found it too sweet, but I wonder if there's a way to increase the savory just a bit.  I think next time I might add a tsp of salt to the sauce.

Lol!  I don't know whether to love you or hate you for this one.  I've never cooked with butter-flavor shortening, I went out special to buy some.  I wanted to get a Valencia orange because I read in one of the forums (I forget which one) that Valencia's have better zest than Navels and since I was using the juice too, Valencia's seemed appropriate.  Well I couldn't find any Valencia's where I went (and I ran out of time to go hunt), so I bought navel.  The only thing I had on-hand for this was the salt and the powdered sugar, and even the powdered sugar is a newcomer to my pantry.  Then I thought, oh no, I don't have an electric mixer, hope this doesn't require one.  I used a handy-dandy wire whisk.  I used a box grater to grate the orange peel, froze the rest in 1tsp increments.  I used just over 2 tbsp of juice.  I only needed 1/2 cup powdered sugar.  I made this as directed.  This actually makes less than a cup worth of frosting, so I'm not sure if the 4 servings listed is 'by the fingerful' lol.  I have been craving vanilla cake for a week now, and decided to try one with great reviews (Recipe #216376), and then I went and changed it drastically, and I think I maybe had different expectations of a vanilla cake, so it needed something extra.  This frosting made that cake.  I LOVE this frosting.  I licked the spatula that I used to spread it, I licked the bowl clean, I licked the whisk...I saved what was left in the fridge, as I'm going to frost the cake as I eat it, lol!

My younger son asked what they were and, of course, the older one told him they were Guacamole Cookies  No matter what my husbnd and I said, we could not convince the younger one to just try the cookie.

I read the other reviews that said they were very time consuming.  I made a few short cuts and found them to be very simple and fairly quick.

I proceeded to cut the cookies out and bake them.  I gathered the remaining dough up and did the same thing.  They turned out beautifully!  I also laid out half of the baked cookies and put all the filling in a baggie and piped it onto those cookies and just put the tops on the filled cookies.  Quite a time saver!

My chickens are giving me a lot of eggs these days, so I am always looking for ways to use them up.  This quiche was yummy!  It goes together quickly and easily, using ingredients that I usually have on hand.  I made as written except that I used whole eggs instead of whites, and I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  I ended up cooking it for about 55 minutes before the center of the quiche was set.  We don't use much salt and I think that the cheese and ham are salty on their own, so next time I think that I would leave out the salt all together.  I served this quiche topped with sour cream and salsa...yum!

Once everything is incorporated, this magically turns into something not unlike nougat in texture. These are rich and sweet, although not as rich and sweet as one might expect from a candy that is basically sweetened condensed milk rolled in sugar. I definitely disagree with the four servings. I got about 14 little ~2 1/2&quot; long rolls out of this after looking at the blog for direction, and I can't imagine that anyone but those with a demonic-level sweet tooth could eat much more than one or two rolls at a sitting (this coming from a rabid buttercream frosting eater!). Not sure I would classify this as a dessert, either. This is more of a candy/confection, although there are people out there who grab a couple mints or hard candies off the counter in restaurants after dinner and call that dessert, so to each his own. I didn't have any pretty colored cellophane to wrap these in, so I just opted for pieces of garden-variety plastic wrap. Not as cute, but it did the job. Just some tips for ease of handling: this stuff is super-sticky and thick, so be sure to either oil or wet your hands before even thinking about sticking them in the bowl to grab the mixture, and repeat as needed. Also, do not lay the rolls down before you sugar them, or you will need a bench knife to get them back up again. Much easier to dip as you roll each one (I learned this the hard way!). Lastly, don't bother scrubbing the bowl with your mixing-fatigued arms -- just fill it with hot water and some dish soap, and come back later when everything has melted off on it's own. Now I'd like to try the cooked version with liquid milk instead of the powdered milk. Thanks for posting!

Absolutely delicious - the flavors are just wonderful... for a non-traditional hummus, I really think you need some zing and zang and this recipe delivers it.  I'm a little curious how sun-dried tomatoes pureed in with the hummus would change the flavor, but adding the chopped pieces, and letting the flavors blend a bit does nicely and adds additional texture.  In the future, I may add some of the cooked chickpea water (I use dried peas to start) to the mix in order to thin out the hummus.

The Joy also calls for ? t. each of grated lemon and orange rind (which is more for tang than citrus flavor), and an extra 5 minutes at the 475 temp.  We bake them with a pan of water in the oven for moisture, and DO worry if it is still jiggly in the center C we would bake extra time if it didnt appear done.  I am so sorry that the other reviewer had such an awful time with the recipe!  This recipe is a bit expensive and takes some time, but it is well worth it for special occasions.

I should have used firmer apples and left the peel on (forgot to do), so juice sat at the bottom of the pan.

I must tell you about a mistake I made while whipping this up - I was looking at the laptop, and it went to sleep, as I was measuring ingredients together...I didn't wake it back up, as I'd read through the recipe 3-4 times. Well, it actually calls for 2 tsp. of the dijon, which I mistakenly *remembered* as 2 TBSP. OMGoodness, but it was too late - I'd already mixed up everything together. So, I added 2-3 tbsp. of mayo and another 2 oz. or so of the cream cheese, to try to bring that flavor down a bit. I also added a touch of honey, hoping to offset the dijon. I mixed about half of the almonds in with everything else, topping with the remainder.

I made this with bay scallops and I'm going to have to make it with shrimp, 'cause I'm not sure if what I ended up with was anything like the original. One change I would make is to flavor the butter with slices of ginger and garlic and then remove them before adding the seafood. I started with my heat fairly low to cook the garlic and ginger but in turning it up to add the scallops the garlic started to overcook so I scooped it all out and added a little more butter to the pan. If I hadn't removed it the garlic would have burned which would make it bitter.  Adding the scallops they released quite a bit of liquid which I poured off and set aside so the wouldn't just boil. At the point the scallops were half done - less then 2 minutes I removed them from the pan, then added  the sherry and cilantro (I had to reduce the amount of cilantro because of my DH) and added back the ginger & garlic, and the scallop liquid. I reduced this all down to thick consistency the poured it back over the scallops. At this point the dish was good, but I thought it needed something, a little fresh lime juice brighted the whole thing and brought out the cilantro without it being overpowering.
