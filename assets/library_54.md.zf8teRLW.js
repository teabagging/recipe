I used crushed Ritz crackers. I did take the suggestion of mixing a little Italian dressing with lemon and rubbing the fish before putting it into the cracker crumbs. Place anything you have breaded into the fridge for at least 30 minutes before cooking. Place on a plate with waxed paper separating the pieces. This will set the coating. I did notice that several had problems with the breading being mushy. I have found the best way to cook fish that has been breaded (and prevent this problem) is to put the fish into a non-stick oven-proof skillet that has been preheated over medium heat. You may add about a tsp. of olive oil to skillet. Saute the fish for 3 minutes on each side, about 2 minutes if fish is thin. Don&#039;t remove the fish from the skillet. Place into a preheated oven at 375 degrees. Cook for 10 minutes (about 8 minutes for thin cuts). The fish will be perfect every time. The crust is crispy with a flaky interior.

First my changes/substitutions... I used *GASP!* imitation crab, fresh oyster mushrooms and wonton wrappers, which means they had to be folded differently as you can see in the photo. For the dip, I only had red wine vinegar which was fine -- I've always used white wine vinegar and soy sauce for my gyozas, so I think this ingredient is pretty flexible.  I had a devil of a time figuring out first where to buy agar-agar (Asian markets, among other places), then how to use the powdered version which is all I could locate.  (It comes in powder, flakes and a block.)  I ended up boiling the contents of one .25 oz package of agar-agar with the chicken broth until it dissolved, then put it in the fridge to set, which it did nicely.  That was cool!  Using gelatin instead of agar-agar is doable, I learned from research, but it'll melt at room temperature, so after chilling, you have to move fast getting the dumplings wrapped.  For me it was worth locating the agar-agar since I'm not that fast! And now for the verdict... well, you can see by the stars it was a total winner!  Next time I'll use more of the agar-agar gel; I was a little hesitant this time which resulted in very little broth, but the flavor was just so delicious, I WILL be making these again.

This took much longer to prepare for the crock pot than I usually spend, and the end result was a thinner soup than I prefer.  Thank goodness I had a bushy basil plant; it looks well-pruned now.

I made as written except I used almond flour (I'm gluten-intolerant). The batter was a bit wet when putting the cookies on the baking sheet (heaping teaspoon size, about 1 1/2 inches apart), but made nice little cookie lumps. As soon as they went in the oven the batter ran and I mean it ran together so that it looked like I had one giant cookie on the sheet ~ like the batter just melted. I thought all was lost but  I let them bake, about 13 minutes until slightly browned on top and took them out and cooled them. I then cut them with my pizza cutter ~ wasn't sure how else to do it ~ and cooled completely. The flavor of these cookies is EXCELLENT, the cookies ARE very soft and thin, but in this case did not hold together very well ~ it was a real challenge getting them off the baking sheet without ripping them to shreds. I'm not sure if this is because I used almond flour ~though I have never had a problem subbing almond flour with whole wheat before in any recipe.

Have made it twice now, the first time following the recipe without variation, the second time trying a couple of variations. <br/><br/>The alterations that worked for me are:<br/>1. Make sure the peanuts are ground into small pieces, because whole peanuts are not much fun to eat (beginner's mistake I made the first time). I also broke almond slivers into smaller pieces for easier consumption.<br/>2. Reduce the nut content overall by about 1/2 cup - so 3/4 cup peanuts and 3/4 cup almonds. When I make it again I'll be reducing it again to about 1/2 cup of each. <br/>3. Reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup - I found using 1 cup of sugar results in an oppressively sweet dish, because the dates are already very sweet.  <br/>4. Cook the pudding with a foil covering over the tin, to prevent overcooking of the top. I cooked it uncovered the first time and it was a little bit too crusty, the second time I covered it for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 10 minutes (160 degrees celsius, fan-forced).<br/><br/>Next time around I'll be adding some finely chopped candied orange peel, and looking for a way for the chopped dates to clump less."},{"name":"smoked mackerel pate in lemon cups","steps":"put the mackerel , butter , soured cream and lemon juice into a blender or food processor and blend until smooth', 'add the seasoning to taste', 'cut the tops from 6 lemons and carefully remove the flesh', 'spoon the pate into the lemon shells', 'top with the bay leaves', 'chill'","description":"it looks really pretty and you can make it ahead of your party.  pop it on a pretty plate, stick a bay leaf on top and serve with toast triangles.","ingredients":"smoked mackerel fillets', 'butter', 'sour cream', 'lemon juice', 'salt and pepper', 'cayenne pepper', 'lemons', 'bay leaves', 'toast'","review":"This was absolutely Delicious with a capital D.......I used half and half and the honey and Oh My !!!

I was not able to fit 2 lb of butternut squash in a single skillet, so I was only able to make enough for 2 people at once.  I used tomato sauce, not paste, and much less oil (olive) than the recipe calls for.<br/><br/>But note: the tomato sauce does not reduce at all when covered for the full cooking time; after the 25 minutes were up I had to uncover it and turn up the heat to get it to thicken to a nice sauce.  I took UmmBinat's suggestion (thank you!) and served with rice fluffed with golden raisins and almonds-- which was perfect, because the squash on its own, even with the yogurt sauce, was *very* rich. <br/><br/>A delicious dish-- wish I had had some naan as well!"},{"name":"smoked paprika and rosemary marinade","steps":"whisk all the ingredients together', 'place in a bowl with the food to be marinated , cover with cling film and leave in the fridge overnight', 'pour off excess marinade before grilling , roasting or frying'","description":"this recipe is borrowed from ‚Äúthe world of spice? which credits it to new zealand cuisine.  the book also credits ‚Äúpioneer chef peter gordon? who uses smoked spanish paprika from extramadura.  i don‚Äôt know where my tin of smoked paprika comes from, but my rosemary comes from the back garden!  the recipe makes enough to marinate 2lb chicken, lamb, cod or salmon.  i‚Äôm going to try it on tofu.  cooking time is marinating time.  the recipe is posted for zaar world tour 2005.","ingredients":"paprika', 'fresh rosemary', 'onion', 'olive oil', 'salt', 'fresh ground black pepper'","review":"Love, love,love this recipe.

These cookies are pretty close to the subway taste and texture! HOWEVER! I strongly recommend lowering the oven to 325 rather than 350, that way you get the Subway experience. Also, you should freeze the cookie dough before you use it. Guess around 24-hours. When you bake them at Subway, they are placed on the sheet frozen and placed into the preheated oven! It is very important to have them in the hot oven. Also. if you follow all of these instructions, pull them at 10 minutes. No later! They will still be a little &quot;big&quot; and haven't spread out but they will when they cool. This is how we make them at the actual stores! Also, if you are really desperate. Ask the manager if you can buy the cookies wholesale. We usually get a box with several bags. It's pretty cheap and most managers are fine with selling you them.
