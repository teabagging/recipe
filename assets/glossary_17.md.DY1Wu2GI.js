The recipe doesn't say whether or not you should drain and or rinse the sauerkraut, so I just drained 1/2 the liquid out of the can, but did not rinse it. When ever I use sauerkraut in anything else, I drain and lightly rinse it, because I don't like that intense sour taste. I figured, though, that if I did that in this recipe, I'd just have cabbage soup. I also added diced kielbasa, that I had pre-cooked, to it. Anyway, I tasted it, and it's delicious.

I had one of my kids that kept asking when we could eat because it smelled so good. I DOUBLED this in my crock pot.

I used two smoked kielbasa that were 12 oz. each an I quartered them lengthwise then cut them every half inch. I cut my onion in half and sliced it by the quarter inch, then I browned it in butter before adding it to the crock on top of the potatoes. I buy my kraut in bulk, so used 4 cups for the doubled recipe. I did not drain the kraut, so some of that liquid was used in place of the water. I only added enough water to cover the potatoes. Cooked on high for 5 hours then I put one  8 oz. brick of cream cheese on top and 8 oz. of sour cream on top of that. Twenty minutes later I came back to stir it all in. It wasn't as thick as I wanted so I added another 8 oz brick of cream cheese.<br/><br/>My mom who doesn't care for kraut loved this and most of my kids liked it too. <br/>Next time I will try to do it correctly , but this was still yummy..

Like another reviewer, I left out the sugar, allowing the yogurt to provide the sweetness.  Granted, it wasn't a very sweet shake, but that was fine with me.  It still tasted great, and it didn't have the added calories from the sugar.  I cut back on the lemon juice a bit, partly because I was using bottled lemon juice, which I find pretty potent, and partly because I wasn't using the sugar called for, so I didn't want the shake to be too tart.  Perhaps it was because I used less lemon juice, but my shake was too thick to blend properly so I added an additional 1/2 cup of cottage cheese, which worked out great.  I tallied the calories in my shake and it came out to be less than 250 calories for one large shake--with almost 30 grams of protein to boot!  The nutrition info shown on Zaar indicates this is much higher in calories, but I think their numbers probably are based on using a full-fat cottage cheese."},{"name":"banana berry pancakes","steps":":pancakes:', 'place bananas in a medium bowl and mash with a fork', 'add pancake mix and water', 'stir until blended', 'spray large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium heat', 'pour 1 / 4 cup batter for each pancake into hot skillet', 'cook pancakes for about 2 minutes per side untill fully cooked', ':topping:', 'spray a pan with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium heat', 'cook berries and orange juice for 3 minutes or until the berries are soft', 'spoon topping over pancakes'","description":"a nice healthy breakfast from the ca department of public health.","ingredients":"banana', 'pancake mix', 'water', 'nonstick cooking spray', 'strawberry', 'orange juice'","review":"This was definitely tasty.

I am 70 and was raised in Rhodesia and ate chicken piri piri from a young age because it was &quot;invented&quot; in our neighboring country of Mozambique. Portugal sent chilies to its two African colonies of Angola and Mozambique about 200 years ago because it could not find a commercial use for them, and it was in the town of Beira (Mozambique) in the late 1890s that an elderly lady managed to produce this superlative of all salivating sauces. She only used two ingredients (3 if you include a little water), but ingeniously created a taste that transcends all others. The ingredients? Birds eye chillies and lemon juice. The secret? Simmer the diced up chillies in the lemon juice for at least 8 hours adding just enough water to stop the mixture catching, but not enough to prevent the caramelisation of the mixture. The enzymes of both ingredients dance tenderly together in this slow process and a flavour is born that is neither viciously hot nor too acidic, but instead sweet, in a smokey way, and piquant without the bite. And a smell to entice the most numbed of nostrils! Once cooked to perfection the mixture would then be blended with a mortise and pestle to a juicy paste adding water, if necessary, for consistency . I, too, have bastardized this process, but it has not distracted from the original outcomes and flavour. I use an electric blender (juicer) to combine the chilies and lemon juice and then (barely) simmer the liquid for 8-10 hours instead of grinding it to a paste. My preference is 100 grams of chillies to 14 lemons for a stronger, hotter sauce, but it can be adjusted to half or a quarter of the chilii content to suit other tastes. I also love lots of salt on my meat, but not in the sauce.

I woke up this morning and realised I had nothing to take to work for lunch so I needed something quick to make that I could leave in the oven. Unfortunately the lack of pre-planning meant I had to use what ingredients I had to hand. Changes: \\nI used nothing but raw cashews (my fave, so probably would have opted for that anyway), 1/2 a red and 1/2 a yellow onion, I was out of mushrooms so used a grated courgette/zucchini instead, I used 2 eggs as I only had medium sized ones and one wasn't enough to bind the mixture, I used dijon mustard mayo instead of dijon mustard (again because it was all I had) and I only had about 75g of halloumi cheese left so had to make do with that. \\nSo not major changes but lots of little amendments. Even so, this was a good recipe recipe. Quick and easy to make and nice to just fling in the oven and leave. The addition of courgette/zucchini was nice, so in future I might use half mushrooms and half zucchini. Only having half the cheese made it more low fat but I think the full amount was really needed as the halloumi was a bit lost in the recipe and it was left tasting a little bland. My only real bug was that I think the herbs were a bit on the heavy side. The parsley worked nicely but the dried herbs tasted really strong to me, and I only used 1tbsp in the first place as I'm not a big fan. In future I will use probably just 1tsp and perhaps add something else instead.\\nAll in all a really nice recipe - great to take to work for lunch, healthy, tasty and a definite keeper.

I made this recipe to go with my favorite homemade soup, Beef with vegetables and barley.  I made 8 rolls/loaves.  The bread was so good that I realized I had eaten 1/2 of one of the loaves before I had even eaten the first spoonful of soup!  I did take into consideration that so many people commented on it being really sticky.  Therefore I added an extra 1/2 cup of bread flour to the recipe and it was still sticky enough that I had to use some spray Pam on my hands and the dough when punching down and shaping them before the final raising. (Because the results were so terrific I wouldn't add any more flour other than the 1/2 cup that I added this time.) The only other change I made was that I increased the yeast to 1 Tablespoon.  I have found that whenever you are using 4 cups of flour for a single recipe equal to one large loaf of bread that using 1 Tablespoon gets a better raise, especially when you are using whole grains with the white bread.  I used whole wheat ground flour with the bread flour.  It couldn't have turned out more perfect.  I only ate 2 of the 8 loaves because within 2 days my DH had finished the rest.  It was a big hit!

My bf and I are so addicted to this bread!  I have made the recipe twice now and it turned out perfect each time.  And it really is super close to Outback's!  To tell you the truth I think this recipe may even be better than Outback's bread!  You have got to make this!  It is so easy to make and the best part of all it freezes wonderfully!  We don't eat all 8 loaves at once so after the first rise, I take it out of my bread machine, shape them all and then put the ones for later in the freezer to freeze up.  Then the next day I want some fresh bread, I just pull a couple out and let them thaw and rise for about 4-6 hours on the counter until doubled.  Then their ready to bake.  An easy way to freeze them is just to form them on a cookie sheet then put the cookie sheet in your freezer flat so they keep their shape.  After a couple hours of freezing they will be hard and you can put them in a freezer bag.  Just make sure to do it right after the first rise.  You dont want them to rise a second time before freezing them.  The coldness will stop the rising process.  So when you pull them out to thaw, they will do their rising process then.  Do look in your bread machine after about 3-5 min. to see if it needs some more water or flour to make a good ball.  I normally have to add about 2-3 tsp. more flour to mine to get a good consistency.  It is still going to be sticky so make sure to flour your hands and surface well when handling.

So, anyway, I quickly whip up these cookies for dessert, only to realize after the cookies are in the oven that I used regular flour instead of self-rising. The cookies didn't puff as they baked; they stayed round little balls. So, as I pulled them from the oven, I hit each one with the rounded handle end of my citrus reamer to make them crackle a bit and form an indention in the middle (like a thumbprint cookie). Then, I filled the indention with Nutella and dusted with powdered sugar. It worked. The cookies were saved, and we had a perfect little sweet spot to end our Valentine's dinner. I have submitted a photo of my flop for your viewing pleasure.

The chia gel is an excellent combiner!  & you know that the more you mix your beef & pat it into patties, the drier it gets.  The patties formed like clay.  Second, they shrunk less & seemed to cook a bit quicker (however, that may be because of grilling methods--I put the patties over really hot coals).<br/><br/>It worked well.  I wish I would have gotten a shot of it for ya.  They glistened off the grill.<br/><br/>I purchase & use only grass-fed beef from a local farm.  I usually have to coat my burgers with vegetable oil to keep them from drying out (a little helpful hint for ya, there).  I have been eating chia seeds for a few months now in my oatmeal & smoothies.  Blah blah blah.<br/><br/>I got to thinking that with their ability to hold on to water, the seeds may retain the moisture that I wanted for my burgers.

Use a very good non stick pan,and you won't need anything apart from a very small amt of cooking spray if that.  I found the extra butter in the pan actually made it harder to flip them, the butter in the batter is all it needs. The dryer pan makes them more manageable\\n\\nTip2..forget putty knives.After trying a few things discovered the easiest way is to first make sure the crepe is thin..wait until it browns on the bottom and when brown enough use a silicone spatula to lift it up and turn it. The first couple of tries you will likely end up with a mess but soon as it becomes clear that when its ready for turning you can move it easily in one piece around the pan, there will be no more messes.\\n\\nTip 3.

I also used red skinned potatoes and red onion, just personal preferences.

My husband prefers the potato chunks; therefore, I did not mash the potatoes. I cooked the bacon, onions and minced garlic together in a little amount of the chicken broth. Then I added it to the soup in the beginning along with a 12 oz can of evaporated milk AND a cup of sour cream. I started out with not a full quart of chicken broth because we prefer it to be thick. But as it cooked I went ahead and added the rest of the broth. As it cooked, it was looking too soupy so I did add some Wondra. Since I needed to save it for my Thanksgiving turkey gravy, I added a pouch of the Idaho instant potatoes. It was the consistency I wanted. It didn't take the 8 hours for the potatoes to get tender. But I kept it on low so it would get the full flavor. Used freshly baked bread bowls from my favorite store's bakery. Thank you Publix! Viola!

I guess due to over smashing the potatoes, crock pot cooked out too much liquid, or maybe the cream thickened up on them? Personally I thought it was delicious. Mine turned out somewhat thin, so I added more cheese to help thicken it up. Here is what I did: I used 4 cups of reduced sodium chicken broth, with 2 1/2 lb., about 9, of Yukon gold potatoes, diced. My husband told me I should use more potatoes next time. I nixed the large onion, and added a rather small leek. I saut&eacute;ed 3 minced garlic cloves, with a 1/2 of a very small yellow onion, just enough to get those tiny crispy burn spots to give the soup a bit of a smokey flavor. I then added 3 more cloves of minced garlic which I did not saut&eacute;e (6 cloves total). Once the soup was done cooking I added the half and half, 2 cups of sharp cheddar instead of one, and mixed the sour cream and chopped bacon into the entire soup. I do not own a potato masher, so I only smashed a couple potatos using a fork. I left most of the potatoes in whole chunks. I only added a small amount of salt at the end.

Having said that, I do also have to say that the kids wouldn't try it as they were put off by the very dark topping. It didn't look good, but it tasted just fine. I really liked the way the orange flavour was complemented with the buttery banana - reminded me of Bananas Foster. Very easy to make. Good instructions although I will take issue with the 1/2 hour baking time - that's when mine finally started to puff up (and my oven was preheated). 45 minutes was what I left it in for, and it was just right, with tender french toast in the centre and crusty, sugary edges. I do think that for the 2 pans, a total of 5 bananas would have been more appropriate, ensuring that each serving gets several pieces. There was not much banana to go around between the 2 pans. Also, the only way this would serve 9 in my home is with my kids not eating it, DH and I had no problem polishing off a good deal of it on our own, so be warned, it may make 9 servings, but you'd need to have other offerings for breakfast to have people not leaving your table hungry.
