I have put on my Christmas/Birthday/To Get list an ice cream maker. I currently don't have one, and that was probably the reason it did. Fail I mean. Instead of ice cream I got frozen cream. You might think I'm crazy already. The ice cream froze WAY too much and it would help if I could find a version of this recipe that doesn't require an ice cream maker.

There are just a few things I'd change around. If you're doing this all by hand/whisk (and I was), I recommend saving step two for during step six (edited). Instead of beating the egg whites right off the bat, I'd wait until you have some time to kill. It cuts down on prep time and you don't have to do it over again if it separates while you're cooking the custard. The other thing I'd change about this recipe is the lack of a clear measurement on how much sea salt to put in. I didn't measure how much I put in and it turns out it wasn't enough. When I tasted the final product, it was only just a little saltier than regular French Vanilla ice cream. Two tips I'd give as well: 1. Have friends around to work on multiple steps at once. We cut down on a lot of prep time because we had extra hands. 2. When you're making the custard, you should turn the heat gradually lower as it thickens. It ended up boiling on me because I left it on medium heat a bit too long. 3. If your custard DOES end up boiling, or if your milk ends up getting a skin to it, just whisk it all back in at a rapid pace. It'll melt back into the mixture. 4. Pour the boiling milk slowly into the egg yolk/sugar mixture (which is supposed to be whisked until it's a smooth, pale yellow color) so as to avoid making an omelette. I went just a little too fast at some parts and ended up with little solid bits of egg yolk in the mixture. When I figure out how much sea salt you should put in for a really tasty treat, I'll let you know. Of course different people have different tastes, so any set amount should be tampered with at least a little until you get what's right for you. ~_^"},{"name":"crock pot breakfast casserole","steps":"place a layer of frozen hash browns on the bottom of the crock pot , followed by a layer of bacon , then onions , bell pepper and cheese', 'repeat the layering process two more times , ending with a layer of cheese', 'beat the eggs , milk , salt and pepper together', 'pour over the crock pot mixture', 'cover and cook on low 8-10 hours', 'i have made this many times at the stated time with great results - best between 8-9 hours , well done at 10 , but not burnt'","description":"i came up with this by combining other recipes.  we keep a small slow cooker in our camper and i often make this when we go camping.  i just throw everything together before we go to sleep and it's ready for us in the morning.","ingredients":"hash browns', 'bacon', 'onion', 'bell pepper', 'cheddar cheese', 'eggs', 'milk', 'salt', 'pepper'","review":"Delicious comfort food.

I decided to make a ServingX4 batch so I had adjusted all my measurements. I had issues when boiling the milk of the milk burning on the bottom slightly, leaving clumps of burnt milk in the mixture. I solved this by straining it before adding the egg whites and cooling it and it worked rather well, as well as made the mixture more creamy in texture, though ideas on fixing the burning would be nice. Turning the temperture down as the milk mixture thickens helps it alot. I also measured my sea salt as I added it to taste and found that for the listed size 1/2tsp of the sea salt is a perfect blend for starters. It is a 1:1 ratio of sweet:salty and can be altered once you have made it once and tasted it. The food coloring didnt want to mix in well, so I advise taking an electric mixer with a wisk attachment and running it on a very low setting for about a minute to get it all properly blended. Mine came out rather ice hard in freezing because of bad planning and I couldnt properly stir it as it froze, but the small sample bowl I made and could stir as it froze came out creamy and delicious. The recipe would be easier and probably better with an ice cream maker, but overall was simple to make and came out wonderfully."},{"name":"crock pot broccoli and mushroom chicken","steps":"layer the crock pot with the still-frozen chicken , the broccoli , and the mushrooms', 'whisk together the two soups , and pour over all', 'cover and set on high for 4-6 hours , or low for 6-8 hours', 'serve over rice'","description":"the chicken comes out so tender it practically falls off the fork!","ingredients":"boneless skinless chicken breasts', 'fresh mushrooms', 'cream of chicken soup', 'cheddar cheese soup', 'fresh broccoli'","review":"This recipe was wonderful!

I think they could have used more seasoning as well since they tasted very plain even with the garlic/olive oil mixture and other seasonings.
