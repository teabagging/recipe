First, the third step is to puree it but it makes more sense to puree the tomatoes not the actual soup mixture..not to mention that something should be sad about at least waiting till the soup cools before putting hot soup in a food processor that could lead to serious burns or other harmful incidents.

You should have seen all of the fat that came out of that bird and dropped into the  bottom of the pan. Imagine how many unnecessary calories I saved by not eating all of that fat.

I am not into whole chickens so I bought a pkg of split breasts so as to have the skin...Being a new convert to cast iron, I chose to prepare the meal in my wok- in the oven..

But- I discovered that it actually happens when exposed to the oven.. Thus- I took the previous directions and started breast side down, turned them over after about 40 minutes and continued baking for another half hour or so..

I did change it around quite a lot, so will not assign stars. A few things I noticed: I used dry skim milk for the filling, and nearly (but not actually, thank goodness) burned it. I didn&#039;t have a thermometer, the battery in my last one having died, and was stirring occasionally, which evidently wasn&#039;t enough. So watch out when heating the milk. My cottage cheese turned out quite firm. I added about 1/2 cup cream I had on hand, but it still is definitely different from store bought cottage cheese. And, frankly, I&#039;m not so sure of the flavor. I&#039;m thinking of trying making cottage cheese with a quart of whole milk and 2 tablespoons vinegar, to see how it differs. The yield from 1 gallon milk was also only 3 cups. I used half semolina and half bread flour in the pasta. The mixture was extremely dry, and I added another egg, and some flour to make up for it, rather than keep spraying the dough with water. That seemed to be the right decision, especially since I think the eggs I used were a little small. The pasta dough made with semolina is a joy to work with, being completely nonsticky. BTW, my research tells me that 00 flour is very finely milled, but the protein (which makes the gluten) content, is often fairly high. The gluten acts differently than in bread dough, however.

Even though it had potatoes, it was a very small layer of thin potatoes.  It was really good.

They have such a nice flavor and although they are not spicey they have a nice delicate flavor that is well rounded.  I put them over tricolor radiatore pasta.  My little girl loves Swedish meatballs so I made these as a surprise for her.  She really loved them.  I used a slightly different gravy because I needed alot of it since I was putting them over pasta.  I made just one change to the meatballs- I had to add more meat.  There was too much liquid for this small amount of meat.  It was still really squishy and wet after the chill time so I added meat a quarter pound at a time until I thought they were about right.  I ended up adding another whole pound of meat and they were still very soft but I left them that way because the recipe says they are supposed to be very soft.  All the other ingredients I left as written in the recipe.  For the gravy, I cooked 3 tablespoons of butter with 4 tablespoons of flour until browned and then added 2 cups of light cream, the pan juices, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp white pepper and 1 teaspoon of beef base.  It was absolutely perfect and complimented your meatballs perefectly!  The gravy did not over power the delicate flavor of the meatballs.  I also resisted my urge to add garlic.  Being Italian, I just want to add garlic to everything and I think it does not belong here so I held my garlic hand back! :)  I ended up with 51 of these little cuties.

I have had them with just a combination of grape jelly and chili sauce, but the amounts were different from yours.  With the amounts listed, it was still very tangy, so I think the added brown sugar would have toned that down a bit, but adding the mustard would have made it more tangy.  So will come back later and leave it a no star rating until the recipe is fixed.  But if I had to guess, it would be a definite do again recipe with the correct ingredients/instructions.

I made the dressing as stated but with just 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar and two juiced oranges so it wouldn't be too acidic.  I don't care for blue cheese so used crumbled feta instead.

It was easy and I loved that I just could do it all in my new Kitchenaid mixer! It went very fast and easy. I just let the mixer run on stir while I asssemble everything as I went.<br/><br/>For the glaze I didn't have powdered milk. So instead of the powdered milk/water combo I used 3 Tablespoons of milk and 3 Tablespoons of buttermilk.

I think I should have let it rise a bit longer (it had not quite reached the top of the pan) and bake a bit shorter. The texture is very good especially toasted.<br/><br/>There is incorrect info in other reviews. This recipe uses the quick-mix method. I use this method for all my yeast breads... and I bake a LOT. You use instant (also known as rapid rise or bread machine) yeast and mix the dry yeast with about 1/2 to 2/3 of the flour and all the other dry ingredients. You then add much warmer liquid. I zap 1.5 cups of cold liquid in the microwave for one minute; it is very warm to the touch. The optimal range is 115 to 120 but it really isn't very picky.  I have consistently great results with all types of breads and rolls. Oh, and if the recipe calls for one package of regular yeat, I use about 2 teaspoons of instant bulk yeast.<br/><br/>One other hint. Boil 1 to 1.5 cups of water in the microwave (I use the same glass measuring cup that I heated the milk/water in) until it boils actively. Move the cup of water to a corner of the microwave and rise your dough in with it (with microwave off). You don't even have to cover the dough because of the high humidity.

However, not exactly like the one from the Bubble Room - but I'm wondering if that was my ignoring 1 subtle measurement. The icing was much lighter than the Bubble Room's - I noticed that the recipe specified 1 c of Cool Whip. I used the whole 8 oz tub b/c 8 oz usually = 1 c, but of course whipped cream is so light that that doesn't hold true. Next time, I'll measure out 1 c of Cool Whip to see if that's the trick. I'll also probably add some orange extract to the cake next time for that BOLD orange flavor from the Bubble Room. The crunch layer is SPOT ON - perfect duplication! Thanks for a great cake!!! :-)<br/>*~*~*~*~*~*~* Update: I made this again last weekend during Hurricane Irene, so it was really humid. I added the orange extract, which made the flavor UNBELIEVABLE. The only problem was that the icing kinda ran off the cake. I had to put it in the fridge to save it and really coax the icing back on the cake right before serving. The only other variable was that I used 1 c of cool whip instead of the whole tub. Not sure if it was the humidity or the different cool whip measurement that caused the difference...guess I'll just have to make this DELICIOUS cake again ... in the interest of scientific research, of course! :-)"},{"name":"quincy jones ribs","steps":"cut ribs into 2-4 rib sections', 'sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper to taste and rub in well', 'mix peppers , onion , garlic and jalapeno together in a bowl', 'line baking pan with heavy foil', 'place layer of ribs then a layer of pepper mixture over ribs', 'repeat layers', 'refrigerate , covered , over night to marinate', 'remove from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature', 'preheat oven 450', 'place pan of ribs in oven , reduce heat to 300 and cook for 8 hours'","description":"my sister saw this on an oprah show and everytime she makes them everyone drools!  a different kind of rib as they are not saucy and sticky with bbq sauce.  very yummy nonetheless and slightly different than other ribs by the same name.","ingredients":"baby back ribs', 'green peppers', 'yellow peppers', 'red peppers', 'onions', 'garlic cloves', 'jalapeno peppers', 'seasoning salt', 'fresh ground pepper'","review":"Baked this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!

The kids enjoyed it, which is rare.  It was not made clear whether we were supposed to boil off all of the liquid before putting the mince and onion mixture into the pie crust, so I drained off almost 2 cups of liquid.  Unfortunately, it was still runny and made the bottom crust soggy.  It also looked unappetizing.  I used frozen, diced onions, which were ideal to cut the cooking time.  I also used beef granules to replace the bouillon cubes.  My frozen pie crust was just a tad too sweet for this recipe, but that is not your fault.  Next time I make this, I will boil off all of the liquid and use a different pie crust (or find a recipe here) that is not sweet (aka a fruit pie crust).  I had a 9.5 inch pie plate, and I needed just 1/2 tablespoon of milk to coat the top.  This was great with the mashed potatoes, by the way.  I ate them together with every forkful.  Yummy!  We rounded it out with a salad, and it was a very filling meal.  We have half of the pie left over this morning.  This is a recipe I will try again with the above modifications.

This recipe was very simple and very successful.  I used 3 Tbs rosewater as part of the water, 6 fresh mint leaves torn into quarters, 1 Tbs lime juice, and the zest of 1 lemon as the flavoring.  I was trying to get the flavor of rose-lemon/lime-menthe.  I infused the mint in the sugar/gelstin/water mixture as it was simmering.  I tried to remove all the mint before chilling.  A few small pieces remained, but they actually add to the flavor.  I can taste each of the flavors I used.  The amount of rosewater to use is really dependent upon the strength you are starting with.  This was good if you like the rose, but I would reduce it to 2 Tbs if you want it to be a little more subtle.  I didn't find a difference between using an oiled knife or the sharp paring knife, so I gave up on oiling the knife.  I would definitely make this again!"},{"name":"quinoa spring   summer salad  gluten free","steps":"if using frozen peas: in a bowl soak the peas in the boiling water , set aside until they have warmed through', 'drain and pat dry', 'in a large salad bowl combine the peas with the remaining ingredients , plus 1 / 4-1 / 2 cup of dressing ,', 'toss well', serve immediately or refrigerate until you're ready to serve]","description":"found this in alive's july 2010 magazine.  they called it a spring salad, but it screams summer to me when i can (hopefully) pick fresh cukes, peas, peppers and onions from the garden or local farmers market.  i'm always looking for ways to use quinoa, have tried this using red quinoa for something different.  it worked well except that i find the red quinoa is easy to overcook, so keep an eye on it.  pair this with recipe #431876, or another simple dressing.  this calls for 3 cups of cooked quinoa, which is easily done, i use jubes' recipe #235534.  be sure to rinse your quinoa really well to remove its bitter outer layer.  it makes a pretty big bowl full which i think would serve 8 easily as a side dish.  i found that the dressing more or less disappears if you leave it too long so i suggest not tossing it until you're ready to eat. and if you're only using half the batch, just toss half.  the quinoa part keeps well but after a day in the fridge i could barely detect the dressing.","ingredients":"peas', 'cooked quinoa', 'red bell pepper', 'green onion', 'cucumber', 'pistachios', 'nuts', 'fresh parsley', 'sea salt'","review":"I tried this recipe and was delighted with the result.

We LOVED this chicken. Usually chicken breasts can come out dry, but this was nice and moist. I especially loved the crispy crust that formed after browning on the stovetop. The brining method gives the chicken enough salt (and makes for a more flavorful, moist breast) so just hitting the chicken with pepper on both sides before browning was perfect. I used a large cast iron pan and would recommend that. The sauce is a must! It is absolutely delicious!! I used Killians beer and instead of a sprig of thyme I used 1/2 t. of dried thyme.  I would definitely serve this chicken with sauce to guests.

I knew I wanted something that would let spinach flavor shine through, and I didn't want to waste fresh spinach on anything like creamed spinach, since that would totally do the opposite.  I thought of just sauteeing it, but I really wanted something new and different.  This one jumped off the screen at me.  Few ingredients, all things we had on hand, easy recipe, and fairly short cook-time.  It was really good!  I used brown rice, which added to the flavor perfectly.  Of course, it doesn't fluff up as well as white, so that was a bummer.  I'd still stick to the brown, though, just because I like the nutty flavor next to the spinach.  Sauteeing the onion with the rice in the beginning gives them a little bit of a sweet, carmelized flavor.  For the water, I used boiling water and just added chicken bouillion granules.  I really don't think it would be as good with just the water.  Next time, I want to cut down on the oil just a bit, though.  It was just a little bit too oily for my taste (which was probably partially due to the bouillion, now that I think about it).\\nThe only real concern that I had was that the recipe doesn't state whether to use cooked or raw rice.

I also used a 10 oz bag of frozen 3 pepper and onion mix (instead of the pepper and onion called for) and 3 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts.
