It tasted like butterscotch to me. I did reduce the amount of sugar, though, and only used 1 cup. It was still sweet enough for my very large sweet tooth, but not so sweet that my husband, who (amazingly) doesn&#039;t like sweets, wouldn&#039;t eat it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do NOT use a small saucepan for the sauce. Use a larger pan than you think you&#039;ll need because it will bubble up. I started out in a medium sized pan and had to switch to a larger one to accommodate what I call the &quot;froth.&quot;  In the end, I got about 2 cups of sauce.  I think that&#039;s a little too much for the pancakes, but it tastes so great on other things (ice cream, waffles, toast, and popcorn) that it&#039;s worth making the whole batch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I blended the pancake batter the night before and left it in the fridge.

I made a half recipe, but this still made a fairly large quanity- I just used a 9 glass deep dish pie plate to set this in, and the jelly is about 1/2-3/4 thick.  I cut out small rounds with a metal cookie cutter, and they cut very well- this is fairly solid stuff.  Now, don't expect Jello if you make this!  It does have a nice dense texture and a sort of starchy mouth-feel from the sweet potaoes but still creamy due to the coconut.  It's not overly sweet, just mild and refreshing- I think the flavors in these would be divine with a Thai ice tea!  This is my first time using agar and i'm very happy with the results.  I didn't have screwpine leaves or extract, so I just used 1/2 tsp vanilla (foodsubs.com says the flavors are sort of similar).  I wasn't really sure about step 4- my agar dissolved just fine without boiling.  I wasn't sure if I needed to cook it really or not, so I got it hot, added the sweet potato mixture and just brought it to a simmer and poured into my pie pan.  You didn't say whether or not to peel the sweet potato, so I decided not to and pureed the heck out of it.  I didn't find that I needed to strain this, as step 3 directs, my food processor did just fine pureeing the sweet potatos, skins and all.  This is a lovely pale Creamsicle orange.  I drizzled the top of mine with some coconut milk, and it looks very pretty.  I ran a fork through the drizzles as you would to get a swirly effect with adding a glaze to cake icing (If you know what I mean?) so they're really lovely- looks great in the cut-outs too.  All in all, really excellent.  Great dessert for a heavy meal, I'm sure and a great snack too.  Neat, fun recipe with very tasty results!

I did not add any salt, as the cream cheese has some sodium to it, and I did not feel the need for it. I did add a good grind of pepper. For the toasts, I used the big Texas muffin pan. I spread the bread with mayonnaise on both sides, as my butter was too hard, and the mayo does a great job. One of my bread slices was just a little dry, and it cracked while being gently pressed in, so you might want to keep that in mind if making for company. Now the Texas muffin pan made a large opening for the toast, and I had trouble getting all of the two scrambled eggs into the two toasts - they overflowed. Not a bad thing for eating, but again, thinking of servings, you might want two toasts per person. The toasts took perhaps 25-30 minutes to make, and I was very glad that I made the toasts well ahead of time.

You may end up with expensive ingredients wasted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don&#039;t like giving any bad reviews but in this case I have to to get your attention to how much time, food and dishes will be wasted if you follow these directions. The prep is well over 30 minutes. The first direction don&#039;t turn on the stove till told to is a mistake. There are two number 7s and a lot missing. When to add lemon zest and oyster sauce are not noted. The food done exactly as written was raw after 20 minutes. Either she means precook the meat and then steam on low with all this or she is missing steps. We had bought the extensive list of ingredients and was eager to try it but after an hour plus with starving family members and raw food we ended up salvaging the dish by dividing it into 2 batches and stir frying in a wok instead of layering in a skillet pan as directed. (It was hard because there was raw meat touching veggies, veggies that should be cooked longer than the meat.) It wasn&#039;t optimal as all these ingredients have varied cooking times but after the thought of wasting it all we did it. The taste after stir frying was good. The veggies and pineapple with the meat were tasty.  The sauces were interestingly good but not sure when to add the two ingredients above.

I was actually about to do so myself ;-).  I found these online somewhere else and decided to give them a try this year.  For a coffee lover, they're awesome!  I only made 2 changes - I increased the vanilla and instant coffee granules to 1-1/2 tsp each instead of just 1 tsp each (hoping to give the meringues a more coffee-y flavor).  So yummy (I'm about to make my second batch).  The only other suggestion I would have for anyone considering making these is to not try and be too fancy - I originally tried piping them out using a pastry bag and star tip like I do with other meringues and found that the mini chocolate chips kept getting stuck in the tip.  So I ended up having to do the plain resealable bag technique in the end anyway.  Other than that bit of difficulty, they baked up great...nice and crispy.  I liked the addition of mini chocolate chips.

We usually cook the fish first, then drain and use that water to cook the potatoes and onions. The salt pork is cooked by itself, usually fried out and then drained of fat.  Also, usually with a chowder, we use two or more fish in the chowder.  After the veggies are cooked, we drain the water and put the fish in the pot and add cream or half and half, NEVER milk and slowly bring to temp or the milk will curdle.

Superb rich texture, tantalizing intricacies of flavours and then I added the coconut and just like that ...poof! My five star restaurant soup vanished.

This was a great soup. I did a few things different, like I roasted the potatoes and pumpkin with the skin on and then peeled them. Next time I will do what the recipe says. It was fine, but I believe this is better. Also, I prefer brown sugar to white and substitued some. When I printed this recipe out, over a year ago, it listed 1/2 cup sugar, but now that is different, so I guess it was changed. I like it a little sweet and used about 3/4 c. sugar in all, 2/3 was white and the rest brown. I doubled the recipe and only used one pepper, which was fine for me. Another would have been okay, if not too hot. I cut the curry to 2 Tbs for a double recipe. A little more would have been fine, I think, but unless you are really used to curry, you might want to start out with less. I left out the Bay leaves, which I do not think made much difference. I was a little short on the ginger and it could have used the full amount. There are so many variations you can make with this wonderful soup, like adding a can of drained crushed pineapple, or some tart cranberries, or some chopped green apples. The original recipe I printed out said to serve with chopped green apples and toasted pumpkin seeds. Anyway, it is a great soup and thank you very much for sharing this recipe. It is a keeper. P.S. To those of you who want to microwave the pumpkin and potatoes, I just want to say, that in doing so, you will lose some flavor, as the roasting makes this much more savory, than it will be by other methods.
