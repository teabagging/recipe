I only had half of a small lemon (missing some of its zest from a previous recipe, and the other half of the lemon, also mostly zested from another recipe was also squeezed of its juice.) Yeah I know it's a bit complicated lol, but I sliced what I had left anyway, added in a little extra fresh juice leftover from a previous recipe plus 2 TBSP of bottled lemon juice.  All I had was a Walla Walla sweet onion, but I used less than half and should have used more.  Most of my onions disintegrated and I kept getting the lemon pieces confused with the onions (their texture and color were the same after cooking together and even the taste wasn't completely differentiated).  I didn't think the onions had a funny taste at all, except the part about not being able to tell them apart from the lemon pieces, and those lemon pieces weren't bad to eat either.  I had 2 large chops, and the exact amts indicated for the brown sugar and ketchup (I used dark brown).  My bf thought this was pretty good, but he hates ketchup and he wanted to know what the red stuff was after he'd eaten it.  He thought maybe he'd rather have barbecue sauce on this instead.  The chops were fall-apart tender, cooked on low for 6 hrs and left the crockpot on warm setting, as we weren't quite hungry by the time this was done.  I served this with recipe #16596.  Though the lemon was pungent when I checked the cooking halfway through, and I worried that I'd used too much, tne end product was delicious.

I also used splenda in place of the sugar and some fresh sweet pineapple, and used the water option, but other than that, made as is.  I can't tell you how much we enjoyed this.    Thanks for a keeper that is going right into my 2007 favorite recipes."},{"name":"carrot zucchini bars with lemon cream cheese frosting","steps":"preheat oven to 350 degrees f', 'in a large bowl , whisk together the eggs , brown sugar , oil , honey , and vanilla', 'dont worry about clumps of the brown sugar , those will dissolve as it sits while you prepare the remaining ingredients', 'then fold in the carrot , zucchini , and walnuts', 'in another bowl combine add the flour , baking powder , ginger , and baking soda', 'whisk to blend together', 'add to flour mixture to the wet mixture', 'stir just until combined', 'spread batter into a greased 13x9 inch baking pan', 'bake about 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean', 'cool completely in pan on a wire rack', 'once the cake is cooled prepare the frosting', 'in a medium mixing bowl , beat the fosting ingredients with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy', 'spread or pipe the frosting over the cooled bars'","description":"getting the kids to eat their veggies has never been so easy!  personally, i like to make them without the walnuts, but i'm sure it's just as good with them in!","ingredients":"eggs', 'brown sugar', 'canola oil', 'honey', 'vanilla', 'carrots', 'zucchini', 'walnuts', 'all-purpose flour', 'baking powder', 'ground ginger', 'baking soda', 'cream cheese', 'powdered sugar', 'lemon zest'","review":"This was so yummy!

Naturally not as creamy as it probably should've been, but I found it didn't matter to us and the richer flavor of the basmati was more than welcome. This is going straight into my favorites cookbook and will be made quite often. It's amazing what a pinch of saffron, sea salt, and fresh ground black pepper can do with fresh ingredients. This made lots for us (as there's only us two to feed) and I'm sure the flavors will only get better as it sits. What a marvelous dish, thanks so much for sharing!!"},{"name":"cat s chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps","steps":"prepare stir fry sauce : mix together brown sugar , 2t soy sauce and rice wine vinegar', 'prepare wrap sauce mix together splenda , water , rice wine vinegar , ketchup , lemon juice and soy sauce', 'put aside in a bowl to chill and let flavors blend', dice chicken breasts and sautee' in pam in a non-stick skillet, 'remove chicken from skillet', 'using a knife or a food processor , chop or process both the chicken and shrimp very finely', 'return shrimp and chicken to pan', 'add stir fry sauce', 'let simmer for a few minutes for flavors to blend', 'add scallions', 'slice off root of lettuce head', 'pull your lettuce cups off the outside of the head of lettuce', 'serve the meat in a bowl , with the lettuce cups on the side', 'to eat , spoon the mixture using a slotted spoon into the cup of lettuce and pour some of the special sauce over the mixture', 'fold up the lettuce up like a tortilla and eat over a bowl', 'serve with some rice to absorb the tasty sauces !'","description":"a low-calorie version of the kinds of lettuce wraps you might get at pf changs. i modified several lettuce wrap recipes to use lower calorie ingredients and ended up with something we really enjoyed. we hope you enjoy it too!","ingredients":"boneless chicken breasts', 'shrimp', 'scallion', 'iceberg lettuce', 'soy sauce', 'brown sugar', 'rice wine vinegar', 'splenda granular', 'water', 'ketchup', 'lemon juice'","review":"This was quite good.  It was tasty and had a nice texture to it.  I stopped by the farmers' market yesterday to pick up fresh peppers, eggplant, green beans and onion.  I omitted the mushrooms entirely as I don't eat them.  Was debating using fresh tomatoes instead of canned but ultimately went with canned.  I reduced amount of oil to 1 tablespoon.  BF in particular liked it, though next time I would add additional garlic and some spices like cumin or turmeric to kick up the heat.  I had arborio rice and used it, which did add to the creaminess of the dish, but I think other rices would work perfectly well here too.  One minor problem I had was with the amount of broth.  I suggest starting with 3 cups and adding more if necessary and when you stir it, make sure you stir the bottom too so it doesn't stick.

So, YES, use this exact same method for more than just tenderloin! <br/>A couple of things to note: bring your meat to room temperature before roasting (I always do this for any meat, and just wanted to bring that to the attention of those who may not know that trick). I rubbed the meat with a mixture of garlic, rosemary, celery salt, salt, pepper and oil. My roast was just under 2 pounds and I cooked for 10 minutes at 500 degrees, convection method. When I turned off the oven, I checked the actual oven temperature 50 minutes after turning it off and it was at 277 degrees. My oven is fairly high-end and I assume well-insulated so I'm thinking that if you have an old or poorly insulated oven that loses heat too quickly, it may work to set your oven at 250 or so instead of turning it off altogether.

That would explain why the unsuccessful reviews all achieved the same 130 temp. That is the most likely reason. #2: You guessed at the weight of your tenderloin and you miscalculated. This technique, as in baking, requires precision. #3: Your oven temperature is not accurate. #4: You peeked.

Yes, I know, it sounds odd to cook it with no heat for the vast majority of the cooking time, but trust me, it works like a charm, and not once have I had it come up a different temperature or finish than it should be, at the right time.  In fact, perfect example... I was just visiting a very close friend out in Colorado... She had a nice tenderloin she was planning on for dinner that night, and I said, &quot;Ummm, let me direct you in cooking this, okay?&quot;  She agreed, until she heard what I was planning, then all, well, &quot;stuff&quot; broke loose.  She is an amazing girl, but very careful in her cooking, and paranoid as the dickens when it comes to additives to food, how food is prepared, etc.  Finally talked her into it, and off we went.  She literally sat in front of the oven door window for the entire cooking time, twitching, while it cooked.  It got done, came out, sat for a wee bit as it should, then once the Quinoa and salad were done, we carved it up.  She was floored.  Tasting it was scary to her as well, but she did (love her for that!), and loved it.  She and her husband ate the left overs the next day...

BeachGirl is correct; if you have a corded meat thermometer that will allow you to monitor the internal temperature of your loin while it cooks, by all means use it! Otherwise you are at the mercy of your knowledge of the insulating quality of your oven. Here&#039;s why I know that. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I cooked my 1.2 pound pork loin for exactly 6 minutes at 500 degrees, then turned off the gas and set the kitchen timer for one hour. I had inserted the temperature probe into the meat and programmed the thermometer to alarm when the meat reached an internal temperature of 140 degrees. In a mere 15 minutes, the thermometer was signaling 140 degrees. Skeptical, I rummaged around in that junk drawer we all have in the kitchen and found my instant read thermometer to double check the temp. Sure enough, it read 140 and rising. I tented the loin with aluminum, waited 10 minutes, and checked the temp again with both thermometers. To my surprise, the temp had climbed to 150, so I sliced the pork loin and tasted it. It was perfect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have a Viking brand stove and it must be almost airtight to have continued cooking the pork loin for a mere 15 minutes to reach 140 degrees. If I had left the meat in for the full hour I would have had pork jerky! Invest in a corded meat thermometer, it&#039;s worth it and costs less than one ruined beef tenderloin. Mine is a Polder and has a remote beeper that I can wear on my belt or sit on the kitchen counter while my meat is outside on the smoker, and that&#039;s great in the winter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, I rubbed the pork with olive oil then rubbed in fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, fresh chopped garlic, fresh ground pepper, and a little salt. Delicious, and perfectly done (medium to medium rare).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing this, BeachGirl.

I have not seen a review for doing the Perfect Tenderloin in a Countertop Oven so here it is. It is sizzling here in Texas Summer so I moved my NuWave and Elite Countertop Rotisserie Ovens to garage, just off my kitchen, to keep heat down in apartment (and have more kitchen counter space). In addition the apartment stove/oven has questionable ability to retain heat or keep heat constant. (I hate this stove/oven. - We recently moved from big house with wonderful appliances.)... I brought 1.5 Tenderloin up to &quot;room temp&quot; by leaving it out of fridge for 1 hour. Then rubbed with seasonings/sea salt/ fresh minced garlic/butter rub and massaged in. I cut 4 slits in top and put some of the rub into slits. (Caution - We love our garlic but, with this manner of cooking, next time I&#039;m going to lower the amount of garlic as it seemed to infuse more than I&#039;m used to.) My &quot;toaster&quot; oven only goes up to 450 degrees F so I adjusted the amount of time for initial cooking of 5.5 minutes/lb due to lower initial cooking temp. After placing tenderloin on rack in small, shallow pan and folding skinny end under, so that both ends were as thick as middle of t-loin, and it made the t-loin fit the rack, I put it into preheated, to 450 F, for 12 minutes. As I was pretty sure the oven would not retain high enough heat for an hour, for the oven-off time, I set oven to &quot;keep warm&quot;, about 150-160 F, for one hour. (Oven is NOT a convection, only upper and bottom coils for baking; no air circulation.) Soon after oven turned off I placed a meat thermometer into meat. It read 150-155 F. I let the t-loin rest in oven for an hour as I was busy with other cooking. It came out PERFECT; perfect pink interior. Never have I had a more perfectly moist, perfectly cooked pork tenderloin, either out at great restaurants or prepared in-home!!!!

I took it out after about 48 minutes and my meat thermometer read about 158 right away. Let them sit for 10 minutes, sliced them up and they were perfectly slightly pink in the middle, so tender!! I also cut up potatoes and cooked those in a separate pan right in the oven with the pork. So easy! The potatoes were slightly underdone at the end so while the pork rested for the 10 minutes, I put some cheese on top of the potatoes and broiled them on high. They were perfect after that.

I had to tweak the recipe somewhat because I used a toaster oven which only goes up to 450 degrees and I like my pork tenderloin cooked longer (medium well). While this may not be the most accurate review, it was what I could work with and shows the flexibility of the recipe. The first time I made this, I seasoned the (1.5 lb) pork tenderloin with just salt and pepper and baked at 450 degrees for 6.5 min./lb, turned the oven off and let it sit for 1 hr. It was 105 degrees afterwards and had virtually no color on the outside, so I broiled it, rotating once, for 15-20 minutes until the internal temperature was 155 degrees, which while drier, was perfect for me. I've since perfected the method to suit my tastes. I preheated the oven to 450 degrees (or set it to &quot;broil&quot;), pan-seared the outside of the tenderloin on all sides first (for color and additional heat), put it in oven, turned the oven off and let it sit for 45 mins. to an hour, depending on who I'm serving it to (internal temp 145 degrees to 155). On the rare occasion it doesn't come up to temp, I put it under the broiler for 10+ mins until internal temp is met.

Amazingly enough, everyone still loved it, including my father-in-law who is pretty much a meat expert and generally does not like meat well done!

I could see the potential of this being incredible, but I had some issues with my meat thermometer, and it turned out a bit drier than I would have liked. Still, it was very juicy and tender, despite being closer to well done. I bought a 1.2 pound pork tenderloin, dried it off with a paper towel, removed some of the fatty parts with a paring knife, rubbed in salt, pepper, garlic salt, and then placed it in a ziploc bag of a marinade using whole grain mustard, brown sugar, maple syrup, and minced garlic. I only let it marinate for a couple hours. I brought the meat out about an hour before I put it in the oven to bring it to room temperature. My oven is fairly new, but it took almost 40 minutes to preheat to 500 degrees. I had cut up baby potatoes and Brussels sprouts, tossed them in olive oil, garlic powder, herb de provence, salt and pepper, but made the mistake of putting them on a baking tray and putting the tray in the oven on the top shelf during the pre-heat phase when it was at 460 (I had read a comment about how the veggies took longer to cook and to put them in earlier). By the time the oven was pre heated to 500 degrees, the potatoes and Brussels Sprouts were already very crispy/borderline burnt. I let them rest on the stove during the meat cooking process, and popped them back in while the meat was resting. I had purchased a meat probe with a digital timer that stays outside the oven. Once I put the meat in, I timed it for about 6 minutes, then turned the oven off, and set my meat probe to alert me when it reached 140 degrees. 15 minutes later, my timer went off, saying the meat had reached 140 degrees (which seemed way too soon). So, I left it in the oven for 45 minutes, removed the meat, and used a different meat thermometer. It read 120 degrees (my meat probe was reading 190 degrees, so I think both were faulty). I tented it with tinfoil, let it rest for 10 minutes, and it still read 120 degrees. When I cut it, it was well done, and like I said, still pretty moist, considering.

My pork was 3.25 lbs and I kept the oven on for 20 minutes. It was soooo hard waiting a full 45 minutes before I took it out and checked it. The temp was 130 when I took it out of the oven, I wrapped the foil it was on over it and waited about 8 minutes and the temp jumped up to 155. The meat was not raw at all, in fact it wasn't even pink. I was so worried it was not going to cook through with this method but it sure did. It was very tender, not exactly juicy, though. I need to find a better marinade or maybe cut slits in the meat and shove the rub in it. It smelled really good while cooking, and I did pour the juice that it was sitting in over the meat after I sliced it.

(august/2004); i had to adjust the ingredients, of course, to serve 150 people. preparation was a fun exercise; the prepared salmon was cooked on a 5 ft. length, 2 x 10, water-soaked, cedar plank and placed on a large, propane-fired grill. the end result was a perfectly seasoned, delightfully flavoured, lightly smoked salmon that had the wedding guests returning to the buffet table, repeatedly, until all 24 salmon fillets had been devoured. when purchasing your salmon, have the fish-monger filet the fish, remove the skin and pin bones.... when you have purchased your cedar plank, soak the plank in cold water, overnight. place the plank in a container of water, with a rock or brick on the plank to keep it submerged. soaking the plank will keep it from burning during the cooking process. not soaking it gives the salmon a stronger, smoky taste. remember, this is not only a recipe, it is also a cooking lesson, so have patience and you will be pleased with the results. follow the instructions carefully, and you cannot fail. it is a wonderful recipe, the end result will amaze you and your guests praise you.","ingredients":"cedar planks', 'salmon', 'vegetable oil', 'dark amber maple syrup', 'canadian rye whisky', 'butter', 'maple sugar', 'coarse sea salt', 'fresh ground pepper', 'fresh thyme', 'mayonnaise', 'apple butter', 'fresh tarragon'","review":"These were delicious, soft and fluffy.

The only thing we felt that could have made it even better was a little more punch.  LIke maybe some stronger seasoning, or some pepperoncinis.  We used wheat pasta, and I think that was part of it though.  But gotta try to be healthy some of the time I guess lol.  It could also only be better with the addition of some fresh grated parmesan on top, or maybe some crumbled proscuitto.  The sky is the limit.  We also subbed out green pepper for the cucumber since my Dh hates them.
