I wasn&#039;t sure, since I rarely drink alcohol and never rum, if I would like the taste of real rum in a cake. In the glaze the amount listed works. The glaze is gorgeous. But in the cake 2 T. simply isn&#039;t enough rum. Snide remarks by the recipe author aside, this recipe needs a bit more rum in the batter. If that would affect the texture maybe the use of extract in addition to real rum is in order? On the subject of extract, I don&#039;t think a person should substitute the same amount of rum flavoring for rum as suggested in the recipe. I use rum flavoring in whipped cream as I would vanilla extract. McCormick.com suggests 1/2 teaspoon Rum Flavor = 1 tablespoon light rum and 1 1/2 teaspoons Rum Flavor = 1 tablespoon dark rum. If the rum amount in the batter were increased this would be a solid 4.5 star cake. As written the recipe didn&#039;t quite do it for me.

I used a whole cucumber (peeled and seeded) for the sauce and 8oz of sour cream instead of yogurt. I kept everything else in the sauce the same. The sour cream made it slightly too thick, so I sprinkled it sparsely with salt a few times to help draw some liquid out of the cucumbers, helping to make it a little thinner. This was perfect. I also added a few dashes of pepper to the sauce. I kept everything exactly the same for the meat patties, but I used naan from the bakery instead of pitas (next time I want to make my own naan for this). After the patties were grilled and sliced, I laid a slice (piece?) on naan on my pannini press and layered meat and thinly sliced onions on it. I put on the top naan layer and closed the press for a few minutes. After removing from the press, I added the sauce, tomatoes and lettuce between the naan and closed it back up.

I had to add another two tablespoons cornstarch to make the sauce thicken, because after ten minutes of stirring my vegetables were mushy but the sauce hadn't thickened at all.  Perhaps because 1/4 cup oil was a LOT too much to brown the beef...I normally would have used a little more than a tablespoon.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to add the soy sauce mixture to the pan?  But it didn't seem like simply tossing the meat in it would give it any flavour at all.  Next time I will marinate the meat for at least an hour before cooking it.  As it was, it tasted pretty bland.  We added a LOT more soy sauce to our plates, but I wish I'd added some red pepper flakes and more ginger to the mix.

I went with the two cups wholewheat flour, rather than try any other. I was using instant yeast, which is mixed into the flour, with the liquid then added, so I tried to calculate the total liquid needed, orange juice plus warm water, because I was using dry milk powder. Anyway, I totally missed the 1/4 cup water to dissolve the yeast, so my dough was 1/4 cup water short. Because I often make bread, I knew better than add the entire amount of flour at the end, and stopped when the dough was ready. Because of this, the bread is delicious. Next time I will read the recipe more carefully. I didn&#039;t change anything else, except add 1/4 teaspoon orange oil. I don&#039;t know what is responsible, but the bread does make nice orangey tasting toast.

Lots of veggies and I love the peanut butter/cayenne flavor (it reminds me of the sauce in Pan-Fried Tofu with Spicy Peanut Sauce recipe #6919, which I love).  Easy and full of veggies.  Most other lentil loaves I've tried are mostly lentils, but this one is interesting in that I think there are even more veggies than lentils.  I really like the addition of the potato too.  BF insisted we added a little cheddar cheese, so we grated about 1/4 cup and put some in the loaf and some on top.

Tasty.  However, I really need to tweak the ratios.  I found this to have way way too much onion, & not enough of the spices -garlic, ginger, cumin- to the amount of beans. I did have to use white onion, not red -- maybe that was the killer mistake?  But also I used a little less than what was called for plus I didn't add any raw onions at the end.  I also would have liked a lot more mango.  I used Haitian Honey mangoes which are a smaller variety than the common Mexican ones in the US but I used twice as much to compensate & I still would've liked a lot more!  The onions just overpowered the delicate mango flavoring!   I'd say this serves twice as many as indicated btw!  I will be making the combination of black beans & mangoes again, but I'll need to create my own version to suit my personal spice taste.

I used italian sausage as mentioned in the intro.  And I didn&#039;t have a packaged &quot;Italian Seasoning&quot;, so made up my own with oregano, thyme, marjoram and basil. I did need to let mine simmer uncovered longer than the 20 minutes, but I like a thick sauce. This really hit the spot!  Thanks for sharing!

I made a couple low-fat adjustments with lite tofu (extra firm) and a mix of part skim mozzarella and low-fat mexican cheese mix (as that was what I had in the fridge). I recommend using a non-stick frying pan. Also I think here in the U.S. coriander is more commonly referred to as cilantro.
