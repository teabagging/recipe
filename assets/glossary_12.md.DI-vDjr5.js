Because I\`ve had sauces burn in the crock pot if I\`m not around to stir them being this is thick I didn\`t want that to happen. Our packages of spinach is 284 g so check your labels. Which I didn\`t realize till my pot was so green and not eye appealing. I ended up making twice the amount of sauce to compensate for it. The portabellas I removed the gills before adding them because they tend to discolor whatever they are cooked with.  This sauce does give the appearence of being a thick chunky meat sauce oppossed to a creamy vege sauce. The texture though was almost airy from the spinach. I would have like the onion, garlic, carrot and mushrooms to be sauteed to bring out thier sweetness. Then added to the sauce. I have a lot of sauce to freeze.

My only reservation was the inclusion of raisins which I don't much like. I didn't want to simply leave them out, so I went to the Zaar Kitchen Dictionary in search of a suitable alternative. I substituted cherries, which I halved. Apple would have been the obvious match but I was dubious about how it would be after two hours of cooking! I used baby carrots, so they needed virtually no preparation and added 4 halved cloves of garlic to the onion (we love garlic). I also added a pinch of sage to the lemon pepper and garlic powder. The chops were wonderfully tender and delicious, and the sweetness of the baby carrots and cherries comlemented the other flavours really well. Thanks for sharing this recipe, WiGal. Not just simple; rather simply delicious!"},{"name":"avocado basil pasta","steps":"cook pasta according to package directions', 'drain', 'meanwhile , in a large bowl combine the avocados , bacon , basil , lemon juice , olive oil , garlic , pepper , and salt', 'add the hot pasta and toss to combine', 'transfer to a serving bowl', 'sprinkle with cheese'","description":"this looks so good, i belive it could be served as a salad or as a one-one dish meal. the recipe comes from better homes & gardens magazine.","ingredients":"bow tie pasta', 'avocados', 'bacon', 'fresh basil', 'lemon juice', 'olive oil', 'garlic', 'ground black pepper', 'salt', 'pecorino romano cheese'","review":"This smelled great in the oven but sadly the end result didn't really live up to expectations for us.

I made it last night, I never made Potato Soup before and always wanted to. I doubled the recipe, used fresh onions and chicken buillon paste. otherwise I used everything exact and it was fabulous.  I pureed about a third of the potatoes with my Pimer, so I could have left out the potato flakes because it was already already very thick.  I cut up raw bacon into 1/4 inch pieces and fried them crispy. I topped the soup in the bowl with the bacon bits. Yum.. My 10 year old ate 3 bowls and raved about it the whole time she was eating. My husband was sceptical becasue it had no meat, (that;s why I thought of the bacon) but he couldn't quit eating it either. My mind was racing with what else I could put in it, like greenbeans, broccoli or cauliflour for the second night, Can't wait to make it for my friends with a big pan of cornbread on the side. The birthday gift comment made me want to try this one over others.

I was looking for a healthy appetizer recipe I could take to a friend's house for a cookout.  We needed to bring something healthful and delicious, as my friend is trying to lose a little fluff.  These were full of fresh, wonderful flavor.  I did have to make a change simply because I didn't have my steamer handy.  First, 2 large lemons was not quite 1/2 cup for me.  I added one more lemon to make it 3.  This gave me just slightly more than 1/2 cup.  It was perfect.  Secondly, since my steamer was MIA, I had to drop these into the water, lemon juice, salt and pepper mixture.  I boiled them for about 2 minutes (these were very thick stalks).  They were still crisp in the center and full of delicious, fat-free flavor.  This is now one of my favorite summer asparagus recipes.  You MUST try it!

I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.  I just chopped the onion roughly, and the machine did the rest.  It makes one life a lot easier.

I had to make a couple of changes due to what I had on hand, but I don't think they changed the recipe much.  First- I had frozen cooked shrimp on hand, so instead of sauteing, I omitted the olive oil and added the very finely minced garlic into the dressing.  Second, I used shallot instead of onion, which worked perfectly since I cut the recipe down to serve one.  Third- I didn't have jalapeno, so I added a dash of chili flake to the dressing for a mild kick.  As other reviewers said, I just loved the dressing.  Dill is one of my favorite fresh herbs, and it goes beautifully with the bright, fresh taste of shrimp.

Definate five stars for ease, fun, and taste.  The DOUGH even smelled good while kneeding it!  I enjoyed the process of making this bread (proofing the yeast, making the sponge, watching the rise, and forming the pita's).  The last phase, which was baking the pita's, made the house smell DELICIOUS.  I used a organic whole wheat bread flour for the dough.  I didn't use any white bread flour for any of the process which is new for me.  I did add 4 tsp. vital wheat gluten for insurance although I'm not sure I needed it.

If you use Mexican oregano use only a little as it is very strong. Traditional Mexican food does not use garlic. This is all you need without all the other additives of packaged. No fillers, no preservatives and fresher this way. Canned chiles are Anaheim chiles unless you buy adobo. Anaheim chiles are very mild. Anaheim chiles or Poblano chiles (hotter) are the ones used for chile relleno. Top them with homemade salsa. Not all Mexicans like spicy or hot spicy foods.

Today I added handfuls of fresh grape tomatoes & Chinese celery from our garden. I'm going to add baby carrots right before serving, since my Hubs prefers his carrots mostly uncooked. Adding wine at some point is nice, too. Awesome recipe! Hmmm. I'm out of yeast.

This recipe works well with all sorts of modifications, additional vegetables etc. I first put the stewing beef in a few tbs vinegar and Motts Tomato Juice for 35 minutes to help them become tender and give it some extra flavour. After I drained them and began the recipe. I used white rice flour instead of regular flour to be gluten free. Before I added the big pieces of vegetables I cooked the meat for approximately 40 minutes longer than called for in recipe#206712 instead of beef broth as I could make it easier. I used 3 medium carrots in all, cut into big chunks rather than diced or chopped fine for more heartiness. I used one less onion than called for, though my onions were pretty big. I exchanged the thyme to marjoram due to personal preference. In addition to the called for vegetables I added some chunks of butter nut squash one time (wouldnt do it again), a large handful of fried okra one time which was a good addition, and about 1/3 cup frozen baby peas near the end of cooking time both times.

Fine chop celery disappears in the stew both physically and in flavor. Rather than the 1/4 cup of celery, use 2-3 medium stalks which is 4x the called for amount (1 stalk is a 1/2 cup).

I made it for lunch this afternoon. A small difference in my cooking procedure: I started by heating the oil in the skillet. The next step was to add the bayleaf and stir for 30 seconds. Following this, I added the onions and stir-fried until lightly golden. Then, I tossed in the green bell pepper and stir-fried for a few minutes, until the onions were ligtly browned and the bell pepper was nearly cooked. After this, I added in the rice(washed and drained) and cooked it(I mixed it twice in between) for a few minutes(3-4 minutes) on low flame. Next, I added in the dried oregano and mixed it well. Then, I poured in the broth(I prepared it in a separate dish by dissolving 2 cubes of Maggi Vegetable Broth with onion in 3 1/4 cups of water- brought it to a boil until the cubes were dissolved completely). I brought the rice-broth mixture to a boil. Then, lowered the flame and cooked on medium flame, partially covered, until the broth had been absorbed by the rice. Next, I added in the freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon to give it a beautiful lemony flavour. Mixed it in well and lastly, I garnished it with freshly chopped corriander leaves before serving.\\nMy parents and brother absolutely loved it.\\nThank You for sharing!\\nWill make it again for sure !"},{"name":"baby carrots with lemon and parsley","steps":"put carrots in pan and cover with water', 'add the sugar and cook just til soft', 'drain& return to the pan', 'stir in butter , lemon juice and parsley', 'salt and pepper to taste'","description":"an extrememly quick and easy way to fix carrots. the tartness of the lemon blends well with the sweetness of the carrots. i got this from a recipe of the day.","ingredients":"baby carrots', 'sugar', 'butter', 'lemon juice', 'parsley', 'salt', 'pepper'","review":"Wonderful dish.

But, I bought some mild chilli sauce and it was just fine - in fact, it could have done with a bit more heat.  I made a double quantity of the marinade and used half of it to marinade a whole 2.1kg chicken cut into serving pieces, overnight. The other half of the marinade I reserved for basting. The next day I barbecued most of the chicken pieces, covered on a rack for about 45 minutes (basting frequently).  I finished them off by grilling directly on the barbecue but found the marinade tended to burn so I only cooked briefly on the direct heat.  The chicken was beautifully tender and moist and very tasty.  The left-over raw chicken, I cooked the next day in the oven at 180C (350F).  I placed them on a rack in a roasting tin, covered with foil and a lid for 45 minutes (basting every 15 minutes) and then uncovered for 15-20 minutes.
