Unfortunately, we were disappointed.  The sauce was so dull and heavy that the fresh toppings could not rescue it.  It was also far too thick and salty.  Heating the beans in the acidic tomato sauce made them tough and difficult to mash.  The contest ingredients could have been put to better use:  we couldn't taste the onions at all, and the jalapeno and avocado were used only as garnish.  The one thing that saved this recipe was the oven-crisped tortillas, so much lighter and fresher than packaged tostada shells.  Ironically, this could have been the best dish in the contest.  If I were designing it, I would saute and mash the beans first, before adding the tomato sauce.  I would reduce or eliminate the chili powder, and season the sauce with cumin, garlic, and chopped jalapenos.  I would either eliminate or increase the amount of dried onion.  If I put in salt at all, I would add it only to the avocado.

Per Pat, the sage leaves and rosemary should be detached from their sprigs but not chopped up; the garlic was peeled and squashed, but otherwise unchanged.; I didn&#039;t do these things but since there was so much wine while cooking the pork, I don&#039;t think it changed anything.  Looking forward to trying a variation on this which involves marinating the pork loin roast for 3 days in wine (or wine vinegar) to see if more pork loin flavor is retained.  Made for Photo Tag. Updating 3/02/14 review for &quot;day-after&quot;: EVEN BETTER, recommend slicing pork roast and submerging it under sauce for 1 day.  It helps for more of the pork slice surface to be exposed to the wine sauce; you can see by the photo that the pork becomes sexier and outshines the polenta.  If waiting to serve 1 day, wait until 2nd day to make the polenta. For the record 100 g butter = 7 Tbsp, 80 g = 5 2/3 Tbsp., 160C=320/325F.

I was just going to post this same recipe but thought I would check b4 I did. Glad I did lol. If you don't mind, I'd like to add my 2 pennies. In an attempt to lesson the load on my wallet, I've use diced bacon rather than the pancetta and at the request of DH I use 2x more than called for in the recipe. I usually start with the bacon and add the garlic in step 2. I find just before I add the rapini its necessary to deglaze the pan which I do with a few tablespoons of water or white wine. I've also use fettuccini rather than papparadelle as its hard to find around here if I don't make it myself. This also works well with orchiette(sp?) or shells or even with wide egg noodles (after all, papparadelle is an egg pasta). Don't drain it too well and it adds enough water so the dish isn't too dry. ALSO, if you find the broccoli rabe to be too bitter it helps to cook it in boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking. I also only spin it once in the salad spinner and leave it a little damp like the pasta. If you do this it isn't necessary to add the rapini in stages just dump it all in at step 3. This is a WONDERFUL recipe. The flavors compliment eachother so well. Even DH, who every time I make this tells me he doesn't like broccoli rabe, goes back for seconds and thirds.

It's a winner!  I was a bit wary about using 2 tablespoons of ground coriander, but it was fine.  I omitted the extra 1/2 cup of water and added 1/2 teaspoon crushed chilli to give it a little bit of heat.  I also added 3 teaspoons of lime juice at the end of the cooking time.  Next time, for our taste, I'd double the amount of salt.  A great recipe that will adapt well to fish, chicken, and vegetable curries.

It's a wonderful combination of vegetables. The olive oil, salt, pepper & garlic promote delicious flavoring. The only problem is that the veggies never get the crisp, roasted texture because there is too much liquid. Even though I seeded the tomatoes, they gave off a lot of liquid. I think I will try this recipe again with these changes: 1. try using cherry tomatoes (whole);\\n2. drain off the extra olive oil before putting on the baking sheet; 3. use two baking sheets so the veggies can be spread out more.\\nWe do love the flavor and the healthy veggie combination.

DH was thrilled to see me making them, and even happier to eat them. I couldn't find any lard for the life of me (not for lack of trying, either), so I used Crisco in the masa. I was concerned that I would run out of filling too soon, so I made a double batch of it. I got 44 tamales using a large cookie scoop for the masa and a medium cookie scoop for the filling (leveled for the masa and heaping for the filling), and I was only left with maybe enough filling for 2 more tamales but no masa -- used it to make a couple quesadillas for DH. We typically like our tamales saucy, so I made a big pot of tomatillo salsa to go with these. I served them topped with the salsa, crema and some extra queso fresco. I steamed these in my big tamalera pot for two hours, but they still seemed too mushy, so I turned down the heat to low and allowed them to cook for another hour or so, then turned off the heat and left them covered on the burner overnight (I made them really late in the day, and wasn't expecting to eat them until the next day anyhow). For some reason, all the tamales I make need to be cooked like this, so I'm sure it's just a quirk of my pot and not an issue with the tamales themselves. This way, we wake up to perfectly cooked tamales and a delicious-smelling house, so the extra time it takes is worth it.

I was a bit apprehensive as I had only made tamales once before and I remembered it being a big hassle. These were time consuming, but not difficult and the results were very tasty. The filling is very flavorful and kept the tamales from being bland as others I have had. Preparation took us about 2 hours including cooking and shredding the chicken, making the masa, and assembling the tamales. Probably would have been faster with more experienced cooks. It makes a lot of tamales - we got about 34 - so having leftovers to freeze for another night helps make it worth the effort.

I made several alterations, but I thought that one observation was important enough to share.  I used fresh calamari, and like others, found that the breading stuck, but was rather fragile and easy to knock off while frying.  I would try the milk bath next time.  I don't have a deep fryer any more, so I just increased the cooking time in the frying pan by about 30 seconds-1 minute.  This yeilded nice golden brown breading.  A note of warning- do to the heat of the oil, I would wait to add the chili paste and garlic till the last say, 30 seconds of frying.  Also, I very much recommend using a splatter guard, as the oil goes crazy when you add the chili paste.  An excellent recipe, I look forward to trying this one again.

It would so readily accommodate pretty much whatever other vegetables you chose to include. On Marramamba's advice, I was sparing with the fennel but to meet our taste preferences I doubled the garlic and apple (I used Granny Smiths) and added two leeks. I also added a packet of frozen spinach, thawed, as well as the baby spinach leaves (LOVE spinach). Loved the cinnamon in this: it blended superbly with all the many ingredients. I'm going to be making this a lot and I can see what's going to happen (it's happened before): I'll have two crockpots on the go making as large a quantity as they can accommodate between them.

I baked it 425 first for 30 minutes, it was not done then I added 15 more and  when the toothpick came out clean it was done. It&#039;s best eaten when warm. I have the German measuring cup so conversion was easy except for the temperature, converting that would have had me heating the over to 437 degrees F, way too high. I did not look at the calorie content of one slice which is 864. I would try cutting the calories by using 2% milk but not sure what I could substitute for Cr&egrave;me Fraiche. If you are not a calorie counter go for it, it&#039;s a great cake and dough one of the easiest to make. I might use it for other things as well.
