This is an awesome soup. This little protestant impressed her jewish neighbors with this wonderful soup :) I have to admit to being a bit too frugal to use two whole chickens, so I removed most of the meat from a warm rotisserie chicken and reserved the meat in the frig. I then threw that carcass and another frozen carcass in the pot and cooked as directed. I also added two sweet potatoes (as requested by neighbors) and I added 2 Tablespoons of grebenes (chicken cracklings) to the Matzoh ball dough. I do have to say that this makes a huge amount of matzoh balls, so next time I may cut the dough in half. These little balls expand very nicely to about double the size. I used my small spring loaded cookie scoop to make perfect 1 inch balls. This helps the problem of over handling and toughening the matzoh balls .

Place the boned side of the roast up. With a sharp paring knife, cut away any excess fatty areas. Use a sharp knife to cut 1/2-inch deep slits in the meat about 2 inches apart, to help the meat lie flat. Cover the meat with a sturdy piece of plastic wrap or a cut-apart food storage bag, and pound the meat with a mallet or the edge of a small plate until the roast is about 3/4 inch thick everywhere, and 10 to 14 inches square.

Break up the goat cheese and sprinkle it evenly over the spinach, then sprinkle the pine nuts over the cheese. Roll the roast up into a tight cylinder, and tie the roast together with kitchen twine at 2 inch intervals. It's okay if a little stuffing protrudes from the sides of the roast. In a flat dish, mix together the flour, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of pepper, the thyme, and the fennel seeds, and press the tied roast firmly into the flour mixture to coat all sides. Heat the sesame oil in a heavy oven-proof or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers, and sear all sides of the roast, including the ends, to a golden brown color. Lay the roast into the skillet, place into the preheated oven, and roast to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 40 minutes.

It sounded so good to me, but I can understand that people are intimidated by the unique addition of the watermelon. It turns out to be a perfect flavor and texture combination! I made the recipe exactly as written and the only change I made was to leave the watermelon separate for leftover storage purposes which probably worked out for the best. I simply tossed the watermelon with the rest of the mix once in the lettuce cup. My husband was hesitant to try the watermelon, did try it, and liked it, but said he would prefer water chestnuts. Water chestnuts would be delicious, too, but the sweetness of the watermelon is too perfect to substitute! Great for a meal or just as an appetizer!
