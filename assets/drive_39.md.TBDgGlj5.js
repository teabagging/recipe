I found MSG at my local specialty spice store (small bag only cost $1.75) and REALLY cheap, freshly made Italian sausage at the Italian market. Neither the vermouth or anchovies lent a distinct taste to the sauce (IMHO). In the future, I think both could be omitted.

Roast for 30 minutes and then lower the heat to 350 degrees F and continue cooking for 15-20 minutes per pound of turkey. Baste the bird every 20 minutes with the pan drippings and baste the bird with the glaze once per hour. Rotate the roasting pan once every hour to help the bird cook evenly. When the skin of the bird begins to look lightly golden, take the temperature of the turkey, and once it reaches 165 degrees F in the breast, stuffing cavity and thigh, it is safe to eat. If you want to brown the bird a bit more, remove the foil and roast another 10-15 minutes. It will brown very quickly due to the glaze's sugar content, so keep a close eye on it. Once removed, place the remaining 4 sprigs of fresh rosemary around the turkey for garnish. Allow the bird to rest for 30 minutes before carving and serving.\\"","reviews":"Every time I have made this dish it has come out wonderful!
