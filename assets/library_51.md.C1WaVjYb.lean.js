Here are a few suggestions that should make it even more awesome:&lt;br/&gt;First, I found the addition of oil to be entirely unnecessary, so only add it if you prefer the extra calories.&lt;br/&gt;To add thickness:&lt;br/&gt;1) use firm silken tofu, not soft silken&lt;br/&gt;2) drain the excess water out of the tofu, then press with a cheesecloth or paper towels to remove the excess water&lt;br/&gt;3) add a bit of chia or flax seed powder to the receipe to add additional thickness (or to thicken it more quickly without refrigerating first) if desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flavor:&lt;br/&gt;1) Add lemon to the desired amount.  For one pressed-down 12-oz box of tofu (which yielded about 10 oz after draining), I still needed almost 2.25 oz of lemon to get the taste right for me.&lt;br/&gt;2) Salt is not necessary if you are on a low-sodium diet.

Next time, I would use more oil and just let them cook on one side and then flip to the other side, so as not to lose the lovely coating.  I agree with the other reviewer that the sauce was too peanutty, also a touch salty--I would cut back on both of those. Lastly, rather than smother the chicken in the sauce, I would reduce the amount and  drizzle it over, so it's not saturated.  I'm also not sure the coffee added anything.

My mouth was watering as I smelled them baking and even when taking the picture the next morning.  Next time I make them, I'll need to be very dilligent in checking the texture/consistency of the dough five minutes after the machine starts mixing it; if it's soft, I'll add some flour, as adding the onions & butter later does increase the moisture of the dough.  I might try making them the old fashioned way, too, as I think I'd have better control over the consistency of the dough.

I asked Sue about the type of curry paste to use and she said she normally uses Thai red curry paste. Locally only green Thai curry paste was available, but they did have Red Thai curry sauce. I decided to use the sauce and doubled the amount as paste would have been more concentrated. The other thing is that they were out of fish sauce. I had read that fish sauce was a type of brewed soy sauce with anchovy in it. The Store had Pad Thai sauce available and anchovies were in the ingredient list. I substituted that with along with a small splash of soy sauce. Other than the forced substitute I followed the recipe as written and served it over a bed of Jasmine Rice. It tasted so good if I hadn't made it myself I would have sworn it came from a restaurant. The only confusion I had in the recipe steps was at steps 5 and 6. Step 5 says to simmer the chicken until cooked 8-10 minutes. Then step 6 says to add the bok choy and cook until it is crisp done 10-12 minutes. I was afraid since the chicken was fully cooked in step 5 it might get over done. However it was just fine. This is a definite keeper Sue. Thanks for sharing such a delicious and easy to make recipe.

There are a few issues with your instructions though that should be corrected/edited as a new cook would not catch them and then this recipe would not turn out for them.  You listed salt/pepper up with the chicken ingredients - but don't say where to add.  You can add to the cornflake mixture but I really think it should wait until you make the gravy.  This brings up another little issue - there is no fat from cooking the chicken so placing the gravy in the pan would not work as it needs a binder - which is where the butter/margarine comes in.  After removing the chicken, I placed them in a baking dish and continued cooking/warming in the oven while I made the gravy.  Then remove the pieces of cornflakes left in the pan (the pan will be dry) and add the butter/margarine to the pan and melt till bubbling.  Now add the flour and stir until well mixed and bubbling a bit.  Slowly pour in the other wet ingredients (chicken stock and milks) and continue whisking while pouring over a med-low heat.  Once you see this starting to thicken turn the heat down lower and add the salt and pepper.  Following this method provided a smooth/silky gravy which had awesome flavor!
