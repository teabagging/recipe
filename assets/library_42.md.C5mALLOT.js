I'm really surprised that none of the other reviewers seem to have had that problem...  once the dough was ok, though, everything else went fine.  The pelmeni I grew up with weren't folded in half, they were little envelopes of meat (a square folded into a triangle with the meat in the middle, then the points folded over), so I made mine like that.  I also left out the onion and added 1 tsp black pepper and 1 tsp mixed herbs, and boiled them in broth rather than water.

It is inviting to scoop up the sauce with the Roulade.  The combination of sweet and sour, with subtle anchovie convinced me to serve Chef Kate in my home again.  \\n\\nIt is obvious the chardonnay I used to simmer the fruit enhanced the chicken flavour.

My go-to recipe now for lemon chiffon cake. I've made it twice for wedding receptions for my children but I tweak it a lot! I make it into a double layer 12x18 sheet cake, with tropical passion fruit curd and fresh whipped cream frosting. To make each layer, I make 1-1/2 times the recipe. Bake at 325. You have to adjust the baking until the cake is slightly tan on top and the sides are starting to pull away. Cool it in the pan for 10 minutes before flipping it onto a cooling rack. I made a tropical passion fruit curd (also known as lilikoi - it's a great way to use up those egg yolks left over from the chiffon cake - about 2 cups divided, use 1 cup for spreading, 1 cup to drizzle), spread that between the layers, covered the cake with fresh whipped cream, then drizzled the remainder of the curd in a random pattern on top. I'm not a cake decorator, so spreading whipped cream and drizzling curd is easier for me. The flavors of the lemon cake and the passion fruit curd are so fantastic together. I've had many people tell me that was the best cake they've ever had in their lives. It's not too sweet and slightly tangy. You can decorate the cake further with some fresh orchid flowers on top or a sugar orchid corsage like the one I found at a baker's supply store.

I hope I don&#039;t offend anybody because this is just my opinion but  being as this is suppose to be an Italian sub, it uses no Italian deli meats. Maybe the roast beef but more then likely not. If anything they would use Italian beef which is very different. They would not use turkey nor would they use regular deli ham. The ham closest to a deli ham like Black Forest, for ex. is called prosciutto cotto which in my opinion has more flavor. You can also substitute the ham for other Italian pork products like, deli porchetta which is so much better then ham and if you&#039;ve never tried it, I urge you too..it&#039;s wonderful. You can also use  capicollo or prosciutto de Parma in place of the ham. My favorite Italian sub combo is Genoa salami, porchetta and prosciutto de Parma all sliced very thin ..this is definitely a case where more is not better! Trust me on this..you can pile on as many slices as you want after but they definitely tastes much better sliced thin. And of course, provolone cheese. You can add whatever toppings or sandwich sauce to this you like. Personally, I think it needs something vinegary. Some of my favorites are hot or mild peppers in vinegar and oil or just in vinegar. Not roasted peppers though they&#039;re good too..but the whole uncooked peppers that are in a jar. The vinager is perfect and you get some crunch to it if you get the whole ones and slice them yourself. Making a salad by dicing up some tomatoes,onions and lettuce and dressing them in an Italian vinagerette or using oil and your favorite vinegar is good too. You can also add a touch of oregano, salt and pepper to it. And my favorite (and yes I realize it&#039;s not very Italian) is to add salt and vinager chips to it. It gives you that satisfying crunch that all subs need and adds the perfect amount of vinegar and salt. You could use other flavors if you wanted to but I think salt and vinegar is really the best for this sandwich.\\nAgain, this is just my opinion and I&#039;m sorry, I didn&#039;t mean to carry on like this but I&#039;ve made myself hungry..lol.

My only problem came up when I tried to form the bread into a ring as described. I did have some misgivings about the whole idea, but it seemed straightforward at the onset. Fill and roll up dough, slice lengthwise, turn up to show filling. What happened was that the filling started to fall out when the dough was sliced - it's only chopped dates, walnuts, orange zest and sugar, no binding - and threated to fall out even more when I tried to manipulate it. I had to give up the idea of making a wreath, and just rolled up and sliced the already sliced pieces to make big, rather messy cinnamon roll shapes. Anyway, the rolls are very good. I'm not much of a fan of sweet icing, and since the wreath was impossible, I didn't bother to make the icing. It's very nice bread, but the presentation as written is not possible for me.

Granted, I added a 1/2 lb of ground beef, but I also added the other ingredients to make up for it.  This had a dry, stiff structure.  Without the sauce, I thought it tasted like dog food must taste.  My kids refused to eat it.  In addition, I tried the foil strip technique, but they stuck to the crockpot and have to be soaked in hot water.  The juices burnt the entire outside of the meatloaf to a black crisp, and I lost a good 1/2 lb of meatloaf because it stuck to the foil.  Since the foil stuck, I had to dig out the meatloaf and pile it on a plate in a big heap.  I'm sure my heat was too high because on my crockpot, if I set it for 6 hours, it is on 'high'.  I set it to the 8 hour 'low' setting, but after an hour, it still looked like nothing was happening (no steam, no anything).  I then set it for 6 hours.  Even though it went too long, that would not have changed the taste of the parts that were not burned.  The 'hole' method did work just fine for cooking the middle.
