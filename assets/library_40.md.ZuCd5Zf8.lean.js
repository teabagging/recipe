Also, because I'm making it ahead, I slightly undercooked the broccoli and refreshed it in cold water to prevent mushiness.

And I just don't do white vinnegar in salads period, but each to his own. I would recommend if someone has good balsamic vinegar that they cut back, waay back on the sugar involved, since it is just not necessary. And since the sweetness of this salad took the zip out of the feta, leaving it like chevre, I would sub them equally since they both will taste alike in the end.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 inch pyrex baking dish. Baked for 30 minutes at 180C in a fan-forced oven. Unlike other vegetable slices I have made, this slice does not have extra oil added with the eggs and no cheese (and I din't miss the cheese as the pumpkin gave an added creaminess to the slice). As I am gluten-free, I used 1/2 cup Orgran blended self-raising flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 cup sorghum flour- turned out perfectly. I sliced into 20 slices which all held their shape. This slice would be a great addition to a lunchbox and would be nice cold too. I could also see it as a brunch recipe- great as could be cooked the day before. I think the slice needs to have some salt and pepper added for seasoning or an alternative would be to use some fresh or dried herbs of your choice.

Are sugar cookies supposed to taste like shortbread cookies? Regardless, these were awesome! Perfect for my DD who is allergic to eggs and easy enough for me to do when I am in a pinch and need to bring cookies to her preschool for Kitchen Week so she can participate and have something to eat with the rest of the kids. ETA:  DD's teachers loved these cookies and have asked for the recipe.  They used these cookies as part of kitchen week and had the kids decorate them with frosting and sprinkles.  My DD keeps asking for more.  I rolled the dough out on parchment paper (the stuff you can bake directly on), cut out my shapes and peeled away the unshaped dough leaving the shapes on the parchment paper.  If you try to pick up the shapes and put them directly on the pan, they fall apart when you lift them up.  Cutting them out directly on the baking paper was the only way I was able to keep my dough in tact. Then I slid my baking pan under the paper and baked for 10 minutes.

These DO taste like butter cookies, but then again I accidentally used a tablespoon of Butter extract instead of Vanilla!  I also ran out of flour and my last full cup had to be supplemented with bread flour.  After they baked, I tasted one and the first thought that came to my mind was the butter cookies in those little blue tins...which I love!!  I can&#039;t comment on how they taste with vanilla (but I&#039;ll do them again this weekend and see).  My daughter is allergic to eggs so we went on the hunt like everyone else.  The dough is pretty runny and not the best for rolling out cookies.  However, I chilled the dough a bit and worked with it in batches.  I would make a good size ball in my hand, press it out with the palm of my hand on wax paper.  Then I peeled the wax paper off and flipped it over (so I would have the flat side).  I used a cookie cutter and then picked the whole thing up in my hand, turning the cookie cutter over and getting the excess dough off around it....then flipped the cookie cutter over onto my silpat lined cookie sheet.  (Clear as mud?).  I then refrigerated the cookie dough before baking for about 10-12 minutes.  The dough still ran a little bit but I am happy....the extra effort is worth it for my daughter.

So going into this I was a little nervous that it wouldn't taste like hers but I was wowed. Honestly I thought it tasted identical but with just a little more umph. I followed the recipe to a tee but used my own rub (salt, pepper, paprika, and brown sugar) and it really added a new dimension. The paprika added a little smokiness and obviously the brown sugar adds some sweetness but surprisingly those flavors didn't overpower and perfectly rounded out the entire dish. I even shared some with mom the last time she visited from back home and she loved it.

I brought the broth to a boil, then added 3 (10 oz) cans of tomatoes & chilies, the frozen (not thawed) meatballs, the onion, and the orzo. I reduced the temp. to medium and let it gently boil for 10 minutes, then left it warming until we were ready to eat. I tasted it before I served it, and oh my gosh it was way too hot! So I added probably about a half a cup of sugar, and I added a slice of American cheese, and that helped a bit, but it was still way too hot. I have never used a can of tomatoes and chilies before, but now I know it's very hot!!! So, we added a lot of sour cream, more sugar, and more American cheese to it to make it edible. I really love the flavor of it, it's just way too hot. Next time I make this, I will only use one 10 oz can (that's all they sell at the store I shop at) of the tomatoes and chilies, and just add plain tomatoes or else mild salsa for the rest of the tomatoes. I had it on the stove on warm for a long time, like perhaps up to 2 hours, and the orzo soaked up a lot of the liquid. When we had leftovers a day  or two later, the orzo had soaked up all the liquid. It's still good though. I might try this in the crock pot with the rice next time, and with less of the chilies!

I followed it as closely as I&#039;m capable of following any recipe. The writer assumes you know a few basic things about bread making that she/he leaves out of the directions. The poor reviews are probably because of this. All yeast bread needs to be kneaded to develop the gluten. I just let it go for 5ish minutes in my stand mixer with the bread hook attachment. You could also just massage it on the countertop. Also, don&#039;t be afraid to add extra flour if the dough is sticky. Bread is never an exact science. The moisture content of your flour and of the air effects how much you need from day to day. The last bread basic is eluded to in her intro. It mentions not having time for two rises. Most bread takes two rise times. The recipe assumes you know it still needs one. After you make the shape of bread you want it still needs to rest and double before baking.    I did use milk instead of water but I&#039;m not sure it needs it. I will try water next time. I also used 2 cups regular whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups white winter wheat whole wheat flour. I used 2 packets of fast acting yeast (2.25t each x 2= 4.5t). That means I was short on the amount of yeast called for by 1.5t. This probably explains why my bread took longer than it should have to rise (over 2 hours) in spite of being in an ideal rising environment but the buns came out perfect. If my review seems overwhelming then you are probably not very comfortable/experienced in bread making. Try a super detailed recipe first and then come back to this one.

I had my doubts about not starting and ending with the sauce instead of the dry noodles, but thought I'd try the recipe exactly the first time.  The noodles on the bottom and top were dry, just like I'd thought they might be.  The sauce was very tasty, and the cheese layer was delicious.  I've known for years that noodles do not have to be cooked before use in lasagna, but they do need to be surrounded with sauce.  Soooo, it would be better to put a cup and a half or so of the sauce down first before you layer in the noodles.  Therefore, the layers would be:  sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, sauce, mozzarella, noodles, ricotta mixture, sauce, mozzarella, noodles, and the last of the sauce.  I'm going to try it that way the next time I try it.  Oh yes, I did reduce the salt as many reviewers suggested:  I used about 3/4 of a teaspoon in the sauce, and 1 teaspoon in the ricotta mixture."},{"name":"roasted garlic rosemary cornish game hens","steps":"preheat oven to 350', 'mix garlic and chopped rosemary together in a small bowl', 'rinse each hen under cold water', 'pat dry', 'starting at neck cavity , loosen skin from breast by gently inserting fingers between skin and meat', 'place about 2 teaspoons of garlic mixture under skin and spread evenly over breast meat', 'place 1 rosemary sprig in body cavity', 'sprinkle hens with salt and pepper', 'tie ends of legs together with cord', 'lift wing', 'place hens on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray', 'bake for 1 hour or until juices run clear', 'remove skin and cord before serving', 'split hens in half lengthwise'","description":"recipe source: health\\ni haven't made this yet but it sounds great.","ingredients":"garlic clove', 'fresh rosemary', 'cornish hens', 'rosemary sprigs', 'salt', 'black pepper', 'cooking spray'","review":"We had a Thanksgiving pot luck lunch at work and I decided to bring in lasagna.

I did my own tweaking: more garlic (because I love it), more onion, extra ricotta and cottage cheese (because I goofed and used the whole tub).
