(note that one of the 5-star reviews does not follow the recipe for the base, and uses sugar cookie dough instead).  The base is too tender to hold up to the caramel topping, so when you cut these, the bottom crumbles. Icing the powdery bottom is frustrating and messy.  I would actually recommend using something more like a Walker?s shortbread (or even USE Walker?s cookies!).  Pure melted chocolate, while fine for icing the bottoms of the bars, is too thick to drizzle.  Choose a chocolate wisely, as the flavor predominates--I agree with the one review that recommends not icing the bottoms at all.

I couldn&#039;t wrap my head around prunes and green olives in the same oven marinade, but... 15 minutes after it started baking, it filled my kitchen with the most deliciously amazing aroma.  I made the recipe exactly as given, but I did take the liberty of removing the prunes, olives , capers and bay leaves from the sauce mixture with a slotted spoon and arranging them around the chicken.  The I ladled the liquid portion over the chicken before putting it in the oven.  The skin turned out golden and crispy, and the meat, both light and dark, was super tender and moist.  The flavor was unique to me, a tantalizing blend of savory with a hint of sweetness.  At first I thought it needed more salt at the table, but then I considered I&#039;m trying to minimize salt in our diets anyway, so I just concentrated on the interesting layers of flavor.  Now I don&#039;t think I would add any more salt when I make it again.  I will make it again--- it is so easy to assemble these ingredients and an hour later have this beautiful and delicious entree to set on the table.  I served it with a simple green salad and quinoa, and we spooned some of the juice and prune/olive bits over the quinoa.

I was drawn to this recipe because I've made meatloaf and meatballs in muffin pans before and agree with several reviewers that the end result is... well, fun to make and most elegant to serve! I've never liked ketchup so I confess to having completely omitted it. Then I found to my dismay that I had no suitable crackers. Thinking cap time! It was I believe the inclusion of the carrots - which I'd grated rather than chopped - that reminded me of a long-lost meatloaf recipe that had among its ingredients both grated carrot and grated potato, so I added about a cup of grated potato. The recipe had just the right balance of oregano for us. Having omitted the ketchup, and wanting to add some extra flavour, I also added some thyme, and a squidgeon (a flat tablespoon) of sour cream - in step 3. Made for Zaar Stars Tag!

I wasn't sure what was meant by lemon flavoring so I followed the lead of a few other posters and 1) added lemon zest to the boiling water and 2) added lemon juice when I added the vanilla. I may use lemon extract next time, just to experiment. Since I like a strong ginger taste, I use 50/50 syrup/club soda mix.

I gave it only 4 stars because I felt it needed a bit more richness.  The lack of fat (2.5 TBS shortening isn&#039;t enough) doesn&#039;t give the bread a silky richness.  I replaced the shortening with butter and increased it to 5 TBS butter.  In addition, I replaced the water with whole milk - you can also use half water/half milk or even buttermilk.  Those two small changes made a wonderful difference in the second loaves that I baked.  I have been baking bread for 25 years and there is nothing quite as nice as a wonderful white bread that comes together easy and is nearly fool proof.  These days I only use Instant Yeast, but I still put it in the 1/2 cup warm water to soften it and I mixed the sugar into the water too.  If you have Vital Wheat Gluten, a couple of tablespoons to this recipe will give you a softer texture and help your bread last longer before going stale.  Finally, I only needed 5 1/2 cups of flour - 7 would have been WAY too much.  The dough should be sticky and while it is mixing in the Kitchenaid, the bottom should stick to the bowl while the sides are clean.  I kneaded on medium speed for about 8 minutes, which I found to be ideal.

I assume that's what the Fifty-Fifty in the title refer so, although the quantities in the recipe don't live up to that billing.  Also, I found that the dried Cilantro completely ruined the recipe for me - it absorbed excess moisture and got soggy.   I also see that this recipe calls for no fat, unlike all of the other versions which have been posted.  While this might be better for your waistline, it leaves the final dish tasting rather flat.

Very simple to make, as well.  For fear of burning the chocolate (and also because I don't get to use it much), I pulled out my double boiler and used it to melt the butter and chocolate; it did it's usual fantastic job.  I was pressed for time, so I put the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes, which did the trick!  I used my cookie scoop (or should I say DH did), which I think was tbsp size, and then rolled the scoops into perfect balls.  Which he then dubbed reindeer poops  (nevermind, he's gearing up for spending the rest of the day with the nephews who are in their late teens, and it'll be reindeer poop and the like for the rest of the day for me!)

These are the perfect coffee or dessert cookie for the holidays.  Just the right mix of chocolate and gingerbread.
