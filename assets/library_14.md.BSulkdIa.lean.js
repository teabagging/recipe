I actually got two pizzas out of this recipe, using the Boboli pizza crusts. I could not imagine fitting 1 pound of the ground beef on one of those crusts not to mention the bacon and all the cheese. I did put a lot of cheese on the pizzas, but not quite as much. This was definitely enough for two pizzas for us; I would say the Boboli pizza crusts are 8-inch. At least the ones in my grocery store are that size. I did omit the pickles as most of my family does not like pickles on their cheeseburgers. I also had to bake the pizzas for about 20 minutes for all the cheese to melt. We had to eat this pizza with a fork because it's quite messy. This did have a good taste, but I think for our family we just enjoy more traditional types of pizza.

I needed a chinese brown sauce racipe for this recipe I was trying out from a box of instant rice.  Most chinese brown sauce recipes I found used beef broth which I really can't eat.  I followed this recipe's sauce ingreds using 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and the soy sauce and brown sugar amounts, but only used 1 cup of chicken broth and just under a tbsp of cornstarch, mixing all together in a saucepan and cooking on medium for maybe 20 mins or so until thickened.  I refrigerated the leftover sauce and used it again for another stir fry. It was great!  I made more because I wasn't sure if I needed more than I had left from before, but I didn't need any extra so I'll be saving the sauce I made fresh for another time.  Thanks very much AudreyBG!

I do line the crust with foil and fill it with dry beans (for weight) prior to baking, to prevent any bubbles from forming in the bottom of the crust while it bakes. I would recommend this recipe to anyone, especially those who dislike rolling pie dough as much as I do. I have been known to flatten parchment paper topped round balls of the dough with the bottom of a plate (to make a uniform thickness), and cut the dough into shapes with cookie cutters, using the shapes for a top crust on no-bake fruit pies too - brush the cookie tops with a bit of milk or beaten egg white, sprinkle with a bit of sugar or cinnamon sugar (depending on your tastes) and bake as directed.

My first time making this it came out far too dry and cracked, not to mention salty.

Second, because my first attempt was WAY too dry, I added about 1 additional tablespoon of milk (so a TOTAL of 3 tablespoons of milk, give or take a bit). And lastly, I added about 1/4 vanilla to the milk to give it a bit more flavor. \\n\\nThese changes wonderfully corrected the problems I had - and the crust came out PERFECT!

Thank you for this recipe, and I hope my review can help some of you who may have had the same problems that I did.\\n\\nP.S.

Made again a week later I had 3 cups blackberries and 2 cups blueberries, I used a food mill on the blackberries which left a half cup of waste/seeds.
