I was looking for a pasta dish I could make ahead and didn't want to make yet another lasagna. So I made the sauce ahead and browned the chicken in the morning. Then I just assembled before baking.

I used only a small amount of sugar as I usually do, but I did add the tiniest pinch of baking soda as I usually do to cut the acidity. (Try it, it really works, but be careful that it is only a tiny bit. You can ruin your sauce if you use too much).

One thing he and I both agreed on: this batter has such a great texture and clings beautifully to the fish sticks; we'd like to use this for other types of fish as well. I also never would have purchased the imitation crab sticks before and was delighted to find them in my grocer's refrigerated fish counter where the canned crab, etc. is. The package of 8 fish sticks is fairly stable (can last a month in the 'fridge) so I plan to keep a package on hand to wow my friends with this simple recipe.

We really did not like it for reasons I will note; however, I think it can be drastically improved.  The ratios of cheese and spinach seemed to be out of proportion to the other ingredients (cheese too thick and sinewy and dish too heavy with spinach).  My husband tasted it and refused to eat any more.  I love quiche, but I ended up throwing most of it away.  I believe the recipe could be a real hit for us if I (a) double everything except the spinach and Muenster and make 2 quiche(s); (b) shred the Muenster cheese and spread it throughout instead of in one heavy layer; and (c) add 3/4 cup mayonnaise to reduce the density of the dish.  I do love making quiche on the weekend so we can slice it up for a quick, 'cooked' breakfast on workdays.  I've been making a lot of quiche lately, so maybe we've become quiche-finicky.

Here's what was done: first the pine nuts were toasted and set aside. I tried roasting a sweet potato and when it was time to slice it the sweet potato started to fall apart. Took an orange-fleshed yam, removed the peeled, cut into 1/4 slices and browned on both sides in grapeseed oil on medium heat (no butter). Set aside to drain on paper towels. Salad: used both baby spinach and baby arugula leaves mixing in fresh mint from our garden . Next, garnished the beans on top, red onion. Dressing: In a glass measuring cup I whisked together the yogurt, garlic (could kick myself for not buying those garlic whistle/scapes last week!), dill, rose water, lemon juice, turmeric and saffron. The dressing was made about three hours in advance and that helped. Thinned the dressing with a small amount of milk. Spooned the yogurt dressing on top of the beans, scattered the pine nuts, lightly garnished with sweet paprika and a sprig of mint. A few red pepper flakes were drizzled on the sweet potatoes. I had to leave the parsley out because what I had on hand was not in good condition and our garden isn't producing parsley this year. Delicious.

I've never actually had corn in my muffins before, so that was a little different for us.  Not sure I cared for it.  They were moist, but to the point of being mushy.  I put them back into the oven to dry out a bit, and it was better, but I think maybe it was the corn itself that kinda put me off.  I guess I'm one of those 'northern' girls that likes it the other way.  I did love the idea of the peppers and the cheese, so I think I'll add them to my regular corn muffin recipe.  Thanks for posting.  It's always good to try something new. :)"},{"name":"oven fries with garlic and parmesan cheese","steps":"preheat oven to 425 degrees', 'set rack in middle of oven', 'peel potatoes , quarter lengthwise and place in cold water to cover', 'drain potatoes', 'heat oil in shallow roasting pan over medium high heat', 'when hot add potatoes in a single layer trying not to crowd to much', 'brown and turn , brown other sides , about 9 minutes total', 'remove from heat', 'can be made several hours in advance to this point and kept at room temperature', 'place in oven and bake until tender , about 25 minutes', 'turn once , midway with tongs', 'just before removing from oven toss with garlic , pepper flakes , cheese and salt', 'return to oven a few minutes until cheese is melted'","description":"these are yummy oven fries that can be started a while in advance and finished up later in the oven.","ingredients":"idaho potatoes', 'olive oil', 'parmesan cheese', 'garlic', 'crushed red pepper flakes', 'salt'","review":"Pretty tasty pancakes; easy to make.

We do a couple things differently though. There is no baking powder or butter in the dumplings. We use 3 eggs, a cup of milk, a good teaspoon of salt and flour til you have a sticky blob. 4-6 cups (the spoon should pretty much stand up in the batter) We also remove the meat and sauerkraut from the pot and then bring the water back to a rolling boil. Then dip a tablespoon into the water to wet the spoon, then pick up a good tablespoon of batter and drop into boiling water. Fill the bottom of the pot with dumplings, but don't crowd. Once you have a batch in, do a quick stir once around the pot to make sure they aren't stuck to the bottom and then put the lid on and let them boil for 5 minutes. NO PEAKING. Remove from water when done, serve. We also make homemade croutons by cutting up fresh bread into cubes and frying in butter.
