I used my father's homegrown pumpkin and canned tomatoes. I like that the onions and garlics are used to make a paste, but you really have to be careful not to burn the mixture. I slightly burnt mine, so I will have to be extra careful next time. If I have the same problem again, I will just mix it into the tomato juice for another time (and only add the curry powder to the oil), as you may need an awful lot of oil in order to not burn it. I'm not sure if it was my fault that it burnt, as I think that I did reduce the heat to a minimum, but I may have reduced it for the wrong pan. My flatmate's girlfriend thinks that the recipe would work better with fresh tomatoes, but I liked the canned. I had no limes, so I used lemon. The lime/lemon is not necessary, but it adds a nice touch. I'm always on the lookout for new ways to cook fresh pumpkin and butternut squash and I can recommend this one to everybody who enjoys Indian dishes. The Masala Winter Squash can be served as a side dish or as a simple vegetarian main course (that's how I had it) together with basmati rice.

There was enough of the lemon/sugar stuff that it was pooling a bit in places though I was sure to sprinkle it on evenly.  I tried a bit that night and it was a little soggy and thought oh, well, at least it tastes good.  However, the next day it had firmed up and amazingly gained a very fudgey texture.  It was firm enough to have good mouth feel and rich enough that I couldn't possibly eat much at a time.  They are certainly for lemon lovers, especially with fresh juice!  It was heavenly to have these, since they are the first dessert I've had in a while.  My kids loved them, as well.

But the other night, I was in the mood for a glaze just like this.  The results were outstandingly delishious!  I tweaked the glaze a little by adding about 1 teaspoon each of Mango Chutney and Apricot preserves to the glaze mixture before reducing to syrup.  As most here are aware, corned beef is packaged as point cut or flat cut.  Even though the flat is more lean and usually pricier, I prefer the point cut because it contains enough fat to remain moist throughout.  When making this recipe, I had also taken the time to brine a regular beef briscuit in a solution of Morton Quick Cure Salt.  I did a light injection and then soaked in 1 cup (Morton) to the recommended amount of water/salt solution.  I let this sit in the fridge for 3 days (4 or 5 would be even better).  Then on the day I'm ready to cook, wash brine off briscuit and then soak in water for 1 hour before cooking.  This reduces some of the extra salt that accumulates during brining.  This glaze made my home made corned beef over the top yummy.

As I'm allergic to stevia and carob, I made my batch with raw cocoa powder and rice syrup, used a little less water and replaced the sesame seeds by hemp seeds because I hadn't any sesame seeds left. Also I used brown rice protein for me, and first I thought the strong flavor of the rice protein would make the bars inedible. But resting time in the fridge made the flavors blend together so the special flavor of the protein vanished, and the result is the best I had so far with this kind of protein bar!

Tastes a lot like cinnamon rolls. I cut the recipe down to  1/3 and it still made a huge loaf, easily enough for 25 servings. This was a lot of effort, but I mixed and kneaded in my bread maker, and that helped a lot. I did end up using all of the flour called for and even a little extra to make it not sticky. Things got a little messy spreading the filling and rolling it all up. Seems like it would be at least a two person job, working with the full-sized loaf. The filling leaked out all around the edges and burns rather quickly once it does, so I had to cover this loosely with tinfoil and I'd recommend lining the pan with parchment paper to keep anything from sticking because having greased the pan doesn't make much difference if your filling leaks out. The outside was done at 60 minutes, but the inside could have been a little more done for my tastes, so I would drop the heat a little next time.

I can only guess, this is how it works in a crock pot, but the slow cooking method in the oven was just fall of the bone amazing. I will say it again, but I have never had so many compliments on the gravy before, the glaze added such a wonderful flavour and I do not know how it works in a crock pot.

The combination of sauerkraut and raw cabbage is very tasty. I rinsed and drained the sauerkraut because we do prefer a milder taste.

Instead of the water I used one 14 oz. can tomatoes. It was delicious with thick chunks of French bread and butter. Will make again and try the shredded carrots instead of the tomatoes too.

There was far too much flour.  I think you could halve the amount of flour and be just fine.  Also, the flavour was very one-note.  The mustard and Worcestershire sauce did very little to cut through the 2.5 cups of wine.  I think replacing half that amount with chicken stock would add another dimension to the flavour, but that certainly wouldn't fix the recipe all together.  Because of all the flour, it starts to congeal immediately as is cools, so you have to eat it quickly to avoid getting a wine jelly with some chicken and veg inside.
