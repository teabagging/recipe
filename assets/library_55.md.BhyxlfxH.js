However, needs something more.  Try adding some lime juice when marinating the chicken - half a lime.  Second, marinate a bit longer.  Third, before you cook anything, caramelize some onions.  Set aside.  Add back in when you add the chicken in.  And add a shot of tequila, the other half of the lime (juice), and the black beans at this stage.  Saute for about 5 min to incorporate everything.  Lastly, since the sauce does not make a thick sauce, and enchilada's should never be filled with more sauce then substance, drain the chicken and black beans with a slotted spool - set aside.  Place the remaining sauce in another bowl.  Assemble the enchilada's as directed.  Spoon some of the sauce on top, then the cheese.  And lastly.. add some cilantro... a whole bunch, chopped, on top of the cheese.  Bake covered with foil on 325 for 20 min.  Thats it.  A much better, detailed recipe.  I also adjusted the so called blackened seasoning.  Cayenne pepper is not needed.  Just use some creole seasoning, chili powder, black pepper, garlic powder and paprika.  Zatarins makes a really good hot, but not too spicy, Creole seasoning.  And lastly, cook to taste.

Although it is very similar, there was something missing in the taste (not sure if it&#039;s a missing ingredient or the measuring proportions), but rating it 1-10 with 10 being best, we gave this an 8, which is still decent and I would try it again with some modifications.  Tastewise the flavor was a little heavy on the V-8 juice.  Next time for the marinade I would use only 1/2 cup V-8.  For the basting sauce I&#039;ll add 1 tablespoon brown sugar.

I did not have pineapple and used boneless breast. I was only able to marinate it for a few hours and had to broil it on a rack(was originally making something else and had cut the chicken too small for the grill), figure it was much healthier and cheaper this way, as buying all those juices adds up.

I made this soup for my husband who had just had oral surgery and couldn't chew, and he really enjoyed it! I couldn't find the 14.5 oz size for the tomato soup, so I bought two 10 oz. cans and added a little extra water.  Even though I bought the reduced sodium kind, I thought the soup was pretty much salty enough, so I would definitely advise anyone to taste the soup before adding a lot of salt. I opted not to use the red pepper flakes because of his mouth and because we just don't like things too hot. But the soup still needed something, so I added some Sazon, a Latino/Caribbean seasoning that contains garlic and coriander.  It's usually sold in boxes that contain small packets and you should be able to find it at your local grocery store if you have a significant Latino population in your area (and you can find it without MSG).  Anyway, this added a very nice flavor to the soup and an alternative to a hot-spicy taste. I'm sure there are many other seasonings that can also work as a good sub for the red pepper.

Even if you don't like horseradish, this is a must try because the flavors are so well blended, that the horseradish taste is mild.  When making this, I pound the ham to make it more tender.  Instead of boiling the sauce, I mix it up and then marinade the pounded ham in it for 4-6 hours (or more).  Then, I use remaining marinade to glaze the meat while grilling.
