Some people have complained about the texture, esp. feeling the sugar grains. It's important to cook low and slow, stirring constantly with a whisk until the mixture boils. It's also important to scrape down the sides and make sure all of the sugar melts. If you do this, there's no gritty texture. I made a few tweaks. I only had 2% milk, so I mixed it with 1/3 heavy cream. I also mixed semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate chips. And: I had the chips melt down in a double boiler and poured my boiling mixture into this. I whisked it for a long time, then I mixed it with an electric mixer right in the double boiler. Just wanted to make sure there were no chocolate clumps. Perfect.

This recipe proves beyond a doubt that reheating mashed potatoes CAN be done without any sacrifice in flavor!  My son, who is a true traditionalist, told me that I could just plan on making these potatoes every single Thanksgiving from here on out!  Not only were these potatoes creamy and tasty and beautiful to behold, but the pre-cooking of this casserole a day before Thanksgiving made my day so much easier!

I'm in the process of using up a crate of fresh Florida oranges sent from a friend, and this sounded like the perfect recipe.  Made exactly as directed, using my homemade vanilla with Madagascar bourbon vanilla beans, and we were not disappointed.  DH was going to be the hardest to impress with French toast, because he's a pancake guy, but to my surprise he requested that I put this recipe into a regular rotation.  DD said the filling tastes like frosting and we all agreed that it tasted like an orange frosting we would use on orange cinnamon rolls.  I meant to slice my French bread thick to make plenty of pocket room, but the loaf was pre-sliced and I didn't notice it until I was home.  I made pockets in the bread as best I could and then used a pastry bag fitted with an open star tip to fill them.  The only real bump in the road was when I realized we were out of maple syrup (I recently discovered that my 5 year old has been sneaking drinks of it straight out of the bottle!), so I gave my family two options.  My favorite ginger syrup (gift from Papa Syd in a swap) or blackberry, but they declined both and found that this recipe is so well balanced that syrup was not required.  DH said he probably wouldn't even bother with the maple syrup if we have it next time.  However, since orange and ginger is a classic combination, I had to try it and found it to be absolutely delicious.  Thanks for posting another family favorite, Sharon.

with a portion of one end of the cake cut off and set on top of the cake or protruding from its side to resemble a chopped off branch, and bark-like texture is often produced in the buttercream for further realism. these cakes are often decorated with powdered sugar to resemble snow, tree branches, fresh berries, and mushrooms made of meringue.","ingredients":"eggs', 'sugar', 'vanilla', 'cake

I just received a new cuisinart food processor that has a bread dough attachment so decided to try your bread recipe.  I first heated the water up to about 120 degrees, then added the brown sugar, salt and yeast and let if proof for 10 minutes.  I put the flour and olive oil in the processor and turned it on for 30 seconds.  I then slowly added the water/yeast mixture through the feed tube and continued to process for about 1 minute and it was ready for the first rising.  I then put the dough in an oiled bowl and covered and let it rise, then punched it down and divided into loaves.  One loaf was wrapped in saran wrap and put in freezer for later use and the other shaped and set to raise for the second time.  The kitchen smelled so wonderful while this was baking and the bread turned out perfectly!!!  Served warm with butter, it has a great flavor and texture.
