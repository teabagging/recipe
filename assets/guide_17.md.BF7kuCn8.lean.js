I made this in a smaller deep pan and made some ingredient changes which somehow made it a puddingy type cake. It was extremely good warm and room temperature. I used only dark brown sugar and added 1/3 cup chopped pecans in the batter. I also put a strudel made of pecans/white rice flour/canola oil/and brown sugar in the middle and on top which created a nice crunch. Instead of potato starch (because I need to buy one which is sulfate free) I used 1/3 cup tapioca starch with 1/4 cup extra white rice flour. (I think tapioca is more glutinous thats why I reduced it) I didnt add any vanilla as I had none. So I flavoured it a different way, I substituted egg replacer for the eggs of which I used mango nectar for the liquid part. Also in replacement of the milk I used orange juice because we are dairy free. I replaced the butter with canola oil. I did have to cook it 15 extra minutes because of the pan I think. I used 1 1/2 macintosh apples chopped as apposed to shredded. We ate it warm in a bowl with a spoon the first day and room temperature the second and that was to die for!

I had to make some adjustments for the lactose intolerance so I substituted almond butter for the dairy butter and plain water for the milk and put a wee bit more apple in because they love apples. I lightly sprinkled powdered sugar on top before serving. Ten minutes later, no more cake and most of it eaten by the non-GF family members. I have been begged to make another one for tomorrow.

I am sure it beefed up the carbs slightly.  But it also added a little diatary fiber.  I have also seen this recipe suggesting Vanilla.  I enjoyed a little sweet that satisfied my craving.  I liked the recipe and it was very easy to make.  By the way, since I only use powdered (Dutch processed) cocoa for my hot chocolate, I think mixing and heating and thickening it in the milk will make a better tasting hot chocolate, with possibilites of preflavoring it like the gourmet chocolates.

(P.S.: My other daughter thinks Kids' Coffee is disgusting, but it's not about her, is it?)

I got frustrated and just ended up mixing the breadcrumbs into the mixture and just made them into balls that way.  Half the batch was made the way that's stated here,  and half are just like rice meatballs I suppose.  The flavor is OK, but these are nothing like you can get in an Italian restaurant.

I'd more than happily give it 5 stars, except DS, who normally loves broccoli, didn't like it at all--and going from lots of broccoli to none isn't a plus (but hopefully he will change his mind after a few tries!). DH liked it quite well and appreciated how chock-full of raw broccoli it was. At the first bite, I thought Hmm--very interesting flavor! and it just grew and grew on me from that point. I used EVOO for the oil. DH was concerned about the maple syrup, but it is very subtle, and not overly sweet despite the balsamic vinegar. Overall an excellent, healthy side that really complemented the baked chicken and roasted potatoes. Thank you so much for posting this recipe, wicked cook!

The sauce  consistency was perfect, but a tad too sweet so I will decrease to 1 tsp of sugar next time. The great thing about this is that it IS a thick sauce with the sausage (I used mild Italian) and ground beef and that makes this set up and slice beautifully. Believe me, there is plenty of sauce, it just isn't overly saucy - which is a good thing!  I found the cottage cheese mixture to be a little too watery, maybe it was the brand that I used but it was a little eggy as well.  I will decrease to 2 eggs and I will use more ricotta and less cottage cheese the next go 'round. I also will grate about 1/2 cup more mozzarella because the top layer was not quite cheesy enough for us.  I think those are very minor details that would be done just to suit my particular family's taste.  Also, I did not simmer the sauce for 1 hour.

The sauce could stand alone with some nice rotini. I added 1 more clove of garlic and think it could have even handled more, and I never add sugar until the last, cause I tend to like my sauces a little more tart and maybe it won't need to be sweeter. I did have to add some diluted tomato juice to thin it out so I could simmer it longer. The only thing I would do differently next time is keep the sauce slightly thinner cause I used the Barilla no-cook lasagna noodles and I think they absorbed more moisture and I think the sauce could have been a little thinner after cooking. This is a keeper recipe and my family is already dying for me to make it again. It wasn't that much work with the no-cook noodles.

I found I had to put on a cover lightly over the sauce while it was simmering because it was spitting all over the place. (ouch)  The flavors were so great together and made this a fantastic lasagna. We were only two for lunch but I always freeze the rest in portions for 2 people and they always turn out fantastic when reheated.<br/>I didn't finish my review and it got submitted ..while I was still typing and wouldn't let me back in to finish.....grrrr.....

The provolone is a wonderful addition that I&#039;ve never seen before.  I did make a few changes of my own that I thought added to the flavor for those with the ingredients and inclination.  First, my family are garlic lovers so I increased the amount to 5 cloves (fresh).  We also love onion so I added a small yellow one.  I had some fresh basil and oregano left over from a prior recipe so I added about a teaspoon of each of those.  I couldn&#039;t find ricotta in an 8 oz. portion and didn&#039;t want to waste any so I used 16 oz. of that and 16 oz. of cottage cheese.  Occasionally I also add 4 or 5 finely chopped button mushrooms just for something different.  I&#039;m way lazy when it comes to the noodles and always use &quot;oven ready.&quot;  I can&#039;t tell a difference.  And one last thing for anyone who uses &quot;preground&quot; pepper - freshly ground is much more pungent and can really make or break a dish although sometimes you&#039;ll need to use less to avoid the burn.

It seems not all dried apricots are created the same, and even though South Africa has great dried fruits, our apricots when cooked become more and more sour. SO ... This recipe LOOKED nice. I loved the look of the ingredients. I diced the apricots finely with kitchen scissors, but was worried about the next ingredients: 1 teaspoon Grand Marnier, orange juice, and 1 teaspoon sugar The liquid was not enough and even at low heat disappeared before the apricots were soft enough. I would never touch ingredients in an RSC contest, but here I added 1 tablespoon Grand Marnier and 1 tablespoon brown sugar. (No Splenda used). Next problem was that I did not understand Intruction #5: Roll each (pastry) square into a 6 inch square. Huhh So the appearance of the pies in the pictures I took is probably not what the cook intended. The filling was still too tart. The baking time was too short. I left it in the oven for 22 minutes and it still wasn't golden brown. All is not lost, however: that filling has the promise of being delicious, and after the contest I might try this again and this time add enough sugar to get the right sweetness for our apricots. I'd also use quite a bit more liqueur as I love Grand Marnier as a flavouring. The cinnamon was too little and could not be tasted. Maybe a full teaspoon? A little more tweaking from me, and this could be turned into great little pies. So this time I'd rather not give stars.
