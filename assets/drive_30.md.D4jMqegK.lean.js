Roast until you can gently tear the meat between the bones, or they reach an internal temperature of 180 degrees F, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely. When ribs are cooled, cut into individual ribs. Pulse RITZ Crackers into crumbs in a food processor to make about 2 cups crumbs. Mix crumbs with granulated garlic, kosher salt and coarse black pepper. Coat each rib in flour, dip in egg wash, and then coat with RITZ crumb mixture. Set aside. Heat oil in deep 9-inch skillet to 350 degrees F. Place ribs meat side down into hot oil (ribs should be about 3/4 covered). Fry in batches, being careful not to overcrowd pan as this will bring down the oil temperature. Cook approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until ribs are crispy and golden brown. Remove ribs from pan; drain on paper towels. While ribs are still hot, season with 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning. Serve with Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing. To make the Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing, whisk together mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, garlic, chives, grated cheese, and Cajun seasoning in a bowl. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate until needed","reviews":"My family enjoyed these ribs but I did make a couple minor changes. Instead of dusting with Cajun seasoning after frying I added Cajun seasoning to the Ritz cracker crumb mix. I also used a homemade Cajun seasoning (Simple Cajun Seasoning here on AR) instead of store-bought. The ranch dressing was a favorite of mine and my husband and turned out great using the homemade cajun seasoning.'"},{"name":"Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Fried Apples","rate":"4.5","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/720x405/1133597.jpg","ingredients":"pork tenderloin garlic salt ground black pepper butter Granny Smith apples sliced white sugar","cooking":" Prep 15 m Cook 25 m Ready In 40 m Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
