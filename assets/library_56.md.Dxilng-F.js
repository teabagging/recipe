I haven&#039;t chilled mine completely yet, but just had to take a small square to see how the layers turned out.  I have three distinct layers - the custard and almost angel food sponge cake are about the same thickness, almost an inch, with a very thin dense bottom layer.  The custard is very eggy, the top, like I said is almost like angel food.  I&#039;m not blown away by it.  I might make it again and keep a closer eye on the time as my kid was making popcorn in the kitchen and I never heard the timer go off after 45 minutes. When I did take it out, the cake was tall, standing well over the edge of the 8x8 pan, and golden, but fell about an inch as it cooled.  So, maybe it was over-baked.

Not sure whether it was my improvised double boiler or what? As a result the sauce got a little too thick and I had to spread it on the potatoes instead of pour it over. This meant that there were areas of dryness (probably my using less butter also caused that), but the taste was still great.

I don't think I've had cake in years, since most cakes call for so much butter or milk. It didn't scream flavor, but it is a lovely, gentle treat!  It rose very nicely, thanks to the baking soda and vinegar combo, and was not too light so that you feel empty when you take a bite. It was just light enough--perfect.  I did reduce the oil amount to 1/8 cup and then used an egg to reduce the amount of overall fat in the cake, since an egg only has 4.5 g, while just a Tbsp of oil has 13 :)  Even with this change, the cake came out wonderfully!

Very simple, too.  I'd been craving vanilla cake for a week now and found this after much searching.  I've made a chocolate cake using vinegar, so I wasn't too surprised.  I made very sure I didn't overmix the batter, but maybe I did by a couple turns, but it was smooth.  I did, however, only stir 7 times after adding vinegar.  I'm a very newbie cook, and even more of one when it comes to baking.  So I rely on very good directions, which I think you provided.  I was a bit worried, my batter looked all swirly when I poured it in.  I've never floured/greased parchment paper lined pan before.  As a newbie to parchment paper, I did my best, using a bit of butter-flavor shortening that was softening for a frosting recipe.  I didn't do a great job, so a very thin layer of crumbs was left stuck to the bottom, but the cake was intact.  And boy did it rise nicely!  It smelled nice too.  Btw, I decided to experiment, and I replaced the entire amount of veg oil with unsweetened applesauce, because I need to watch my fat intake, and all I had was olive or canola oil.  I think I have never had vanilla cake before and I just thought I did.  I was surprised and caught off guard by its very vanilla-y flavor.  I guess I was craving a regular yellow cake  This was also darker than I expected.  Again, I think I may have had the wrong expectations for what vanilla cake was.  My bf isn't a cake fan, so I didn't bother him with trying this.  I tried a bite plain, which was interesting.  The texture was heavier than some reviewers mentioned, and even though 30 mins was perfect and the toothpick came out clean, it was a bit damp, yet not moist on the inside.  I don't know if it's due to my TOTAL applesauce/oil replacement.  Normally I only sub part of the fat for applesauce.  (This is getting long, sorry).  I frosted it with Recipe #291219, which really added to it, and made it like a creamsicle cake.  I am still happy overall with this cake.  I think it'll make a great base for my experimentation with fruit toppings and maybe some chocolate sauce.  Not sure yet.  Thanks so much for sharing, and thanks for your patient reading!  When I make this again, I'll try with the veg oil.
