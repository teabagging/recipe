And thanks for sharing!) ;o) August 1, 2005: It took me just over a year to get around to trying this recipe, although it's been rattling around in my brain since I first read it! And it was just as good as I imagined it would be! I made this last night to take to my DH's boss's potluck birthday party, and you should have seen and heard the reactions of people when they tried it! It would have warmed your heart! I had numerous people ask me for the recipe, and it is such an easy recipe to put together, I was able to rattle it off from memory. The coffee wasn't quite as chilled as it should have been, but it didn't seem to affect the punch overall. I made the punch exactly as the recipe called, except after it was assembled I sprinkled some grated sweet chocolate (I used Hershey's) over the top of the whipped cream dollops. It made for a very nice presentation, and the little bits of chocolate were fun to run into when drinking the punch. My DD, who had arrived at the party separately from us, tried it and fell in love with it. She came up to me later, wide-eyed and effusively said, I didn't know YOU brought that punch...can you make that for our wedding reception?!? (she's getting married this October).

I really want to love it!  I had 2 problems.  The first was that the sugar cookie dough was hard to work with.  I think next time I'll actually try making the dough, like some of the others who rated this did.  That takes away part of what is supposed to make this easy, but it was a huge pain getting the dough out of the tube and it was so soft and sticky.  The dough made it take much longer than the 15 minutes of prep that it called for!  The other problem I had was that the top never seemed to cook.  I baked as directed, and the top was browning so I thought it was done.  The bottom crust seemed cooked on the edges, but perhaps not all the way done in the middle.  However, I could handle that.  The bottom just seemed like a slightly underbaked cookie - which is how I prefer them.  But the top crust was still wet.  The dough was clearly still jiggly under the brown parts, so I put it back in for another 15 minutes.

What I bought at the store was very lean so the Kielbasa was on the drier side.  So next time I'll use about an 85%lean meat, also I want to try smoking some after I make it.

By the time I was ready to put it in the oven (around 5pm) I wasn't sure if the noodles had had enough time to soak up the liquid, so I ended up baking it for the full 45 minutes.  Oh, it smelled so yummy while baking!  Next time I would cut down a bit on the water (maybe only add 1-1/2 cups) as there was still plenty of liquid even after I let it sit out of the oven for 15 minutes -- otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  It was delicious -- hubby even had 2 servings, so I know it was good 'cuz that hardly ever happens!  Thanks for posting -- I'll be making this again!  -M =)"},{"name":"cafe borgatta","steps":"heat milk in a small saucepan', 'sift cocoa and sugar into milk and whisk to blend', 'stir in espresso', 'divide equally into four small espresso or demitasse cups', 'top with whipped cream and grated orange', 'makes 4 servings'","description":"","ingredients":"2% low-fat milk', 'unsweetened cocoa', 'granulated sugar', 'espresso', 'sweetened whipped cream'","review":"This was pretty good.

It was an easy worry free dish to cook.  I chopped the onion and parsley and assembled the other ingredients while I was browning the chicken thighs. Tossed it all together and into the oven.

When I told the family we were having chicken braised with 40 CLOVES OF GARLIC, they were shocked but moaned with delight when I unveiled the chicken at the dinner table. There was the golden chicken swimming in bed of garlic, onion and cooking juices. Don't let the 40 cloves put you off.  The braising caramelises the garlic to a soft clove of delightful flavour with a  hint of cinnamon and spice.  One step that I did do differently was that I microwaved the bulbs of garlic skin and all for 30 seconds and squeezed the cloves of garlic out of their skins.  However, next time I will be peeling the garlic and parboiling them.  It will be interesting to see if that changes the flavour of the dish.  This is worth trying.

I cook the chicken as the recipe states, but definitely adjust the cooking time so that the chicken is still tender when it comes out of the pan.

I did bake it for a friend's birthday, and it was really festive. Rather than distinct layers, for some reason my cake turned out beautifully marbled, with red all around the outside and green tendrils snaking into the yellow interior of the cake. I must admit that I wasn't convinced that the flavors would go well together (even though I'm a big fan of all three), but it turned out to be a very subtle cake with a flavor that was almost indefinable (albeit distinctly fruity and fragrant) if you didn't already know what was in it.\\n\\nI did make several changes to the recipe. First: it doesn't specify a baking temperature or a pan size. I went with an 8 pan; baaaad move. The unbaked batter was almost level with the top of the pan, and as it baked, some of the batter came over the sides of the pan (fortunately just a bit, and I had put some aluminum foil down over the baking rack just in case). I also decided to try baking it at 350 degrees, which worked, but took about twice as long as the recipe suggested.\\n\\nThe increased baking time could also have been a result of the fruit that I added to the cake. Even though I purchased mostly natural flavor extracts (from Faerie's Finest online), I was concerned that the cake might taste like fruit extract rather than fruit, so I added 1 well-drained 8-oz can of crushed pineapple to the yellow layer, and about 8 oz diced fresh strawberries to the red layer. Also, the rose essence that I purchased didn't really smell like what I think of as rose, so instead I used 1 T rosewater, which imparted a really nice flavor and fragrance to the green layer. (I then ordered the cake red/yellow/green, from bottom to top, so that the heavier fruit was at the bottom of the cake.) I suspect that this extra liquid may have increased my baking time.\\n\\nFinally, I decided to try including some icing with the cake, on the assumption that it would be more exciting to slice into a frosted white confection to reveal the vivid colors within. I tried Silky Vanilla Butter Frosting (#23715), which had a nice flavor but was a pain to frost (especially on the mushroom-shaped cake that resulted from my 8 pan). Still, it did the job of concealing my vivid green cake top, and the interior did create a bit of a sensation when it was cut!\\n\\nI'm giving this recipe a rating of five stars because I thought it was really pretty, memorable, and had an intriguing, unusual and delicious flavor. I liked the extra fruit in it, but I don't think it was absolutely necessary. But, I would definitely recommend using at least a 9 cake pan, be prepared to wait longer for it to bake, and try out an innocent-looking icing to increase the wow factor."},{"name":"cajun seafood gumbo","steps":"to make stock: boil the shrimp peelings and heads for approximately 2 hours', 'start with plenty of water because you need to end up with enough for 10 cups', 'make roux', 'this is done by browning flour and lard / oil stirring frequently until dark brown', 'add chopped vegetables and saut', 'pour 10 cups of stock in separate large pot and add roux slowly , stirring often until well blended', 'add bay leaves and seasonings and peeled tomatoes', 'saut okra then add to pot', 'add sausages to pot', 'simmer on low for 25-30 minutes', 'add shrimp , crab and oysters', 'turn fire up', 'cook 5 minutes and stir often', 'remove from heat , cover and let sit for 20 minutes', 'serve over rice'","description":"this is my mil's best gumbo recipe! not watery, not spicy - just right!","ingredients":"onions', 'green bell pepper', 'vegetable oil', 'flour', 'garlic', 'shrimp stock', 'andouille sausage', 'kielbasa', 'oyster', 'crabmeat', 'raw shrimp', 'celery', 'frozen okra', 'tomatoes', 'bay leaves', 'salt', 'white pepper', 'cayenne pepper', 'thyme', 'oregano', 'black pepper'","review":"This recipe was great, I had three children helping me, one 6 year old and two 4 year olds.

For me, I felt like the recipe was a bit too heavy on the dry ingredients. Which I should have been aware of when choosing the recipe, but that was the risk I was to take.

If I were to make this recipe again I think I&#039;ll try adding a bit more butter milk - maybe a half cup - and likely double on the sugar. There is enough dry ingredients that I don&#039;t think the added buttermilk would compromise the integrity of the butter and since the sugar is added with the wet ingredients, I don&#039;t think it will really affect the way the eggs work with the batter.
