These are very good.  A couple of tips: take the time to spray the muffin pans extremely well.  Mine came out fine after thoroughly coating with the baking with flour spray.  I think it might be important to use this type of spray vs. the regular type of Pam spray.  The muffins do not rise too much, so they have a rather flat top.  Don't fill past 3/4 full otherwise they look less pretty when they have a wider flat top.  I used a scant or barely level 1 cookie scoopful for each mini muffin cup and it worked perfect.  The yield and bake times are WAY off!  A HALF recipe turned out 48 mini muffins PLUS 12 regular size muffins (a pleasant surprise!).  The bake time using oven temps as directed was only 10-15 minutes.  I didn't wait for them to get brown but took them out when the center was set and toothpick inserted came out clean.

After receiving this assurance, and after some of the hard-to-find-where-I-live ingredients showed up in the mail (along with some other goodies -- a wonderful surprise package!!) I proceeded as follows: After the birdie was properly thawed, I set about cutting it into legs, thighs, wings and breast halves. Then I cut each breast half into thirds in an attempt to approximate the size and shape of chicken thighs. I did not remove the skin, as don't generally do that - the bird's lost most of its dignity by this point, I'll let it keep its skin!\\n\\nAs I was mixing up the marinade/sauce ingredients, I tasted the individual items and immediately became concerned that it would turn out too hot for my family to eat! After an emergency consultation with the Chef, and his assurance that some of heat would disappear during cooking, I felt confident that everyone would be able to eat it, so I used the full amounts of all the marinade ingredients. From that point, I proceeded as the recipe instructs, but the refrigerator was full, so I kept it overnight in my seasonal walk-in refrigerator -- also known as The Garage. (I made this a few weeks ago, when it was still consistently cold out there!) The chicken was done in about 6 hours, but I let it go for about 2 more hours because we weren't ready to eat yet - I hadn't made the rice yet, and the family was working together on chores. Nobody was complaining about being hungry, so I wasn't going to interrupt them for a meal! I sneaked off for a minute and pressed my other crockpot into service to make Mirj's Perfect Crockpot Rice. By the time the rice was ready and the chores were finished, the chicken was even more tender and it just about fell off the bones as I served it. It was a little bit hotter than the kids like most of the time, but the whole combination was so delicious that they ate it anyway and wanted seconds. (Next time, I'll use a little less of the hot stuff, but not much less) I realized after we were done, that I had forgotten the cashews. Then I found out that someone had gotten into them and I wouldn't have had any to put on this anyway.

I didn't notice that I was supposed to marinate the chicken until I was just getting ready to prep it and toss it in the crockpot.

I also hadn't noticed the verde part of the salsa as I was just about to toss in some ordinary tomato salsa. I didn't have salsa verde on hand, but I did have some green jalapeno salsa and substituted with that. I cooked my chicken for 4.5 hours and found it to be cooked through. The sauce was a bit watery, so I removed the chicken from the crockpot, and stirred in a slurry of water mixed with cornstarch and turned the heat setting to high to thicken it up. I served this with steamed rice. The flavor of the chicken was just a little spicy even though I used the milder chilli sauce instead of the sambal (while cooking). It was just within my daughter's tolerance for spiciness, and although she is a picky eater she ate this well. I spooned some sambal oelek on top of the chicken for myself to raise the heat level. It was very good! I shouldn't have waited so long to make this!

I did everything exactly as was printed. I had to use powdered buttermilk but next time I\`ll try it with the real thing and it will probably be even better!I had leftover flour/cornmeal so I\`ll use less next time.It worked great to put the coated corn in a small colander over the garbage to separate it easily.My husband & I enjoyed it to the max! and its going into my Favorites cookbook. I had 9 fried corn recipes saved into my cookbook but now I\`m going to get rid of the others because I know this can\`t be beat!

It came out beautifully risen, light & fluffy & ohh sooo vanilla-ry!!! BUT...the recipe *as written*, needs some attention.  Step 11-17 is where things get odd. It doesn't say that refrigerating the base then bringing it back to room temp is optional which I think it is...I didn't make the base ahead of time so after adding the egg yolks to the base, I let it cool to room temp and continued on as directed.  I didn't bother with the plastic wrap & no 'skin' formed.  :) The directions say to put the base in a 1qt container then put the saucepan in the ice-water bath (?)    It calls for 1/4c grape juice...this is the 1/4c granulated sugar added to the egg whites.  I just think it could be rewritten to be easier to follow & these few inconsistencies addressed.

This was my first attempt at veganizing a pan-fried shrimp recipe that's traditional in my NC family's Thanksgiving lineup... omni hubby & I were both pleased with how it turned out! I followed the recipe for the dough exactly, except I had to add a couple tablespoons or so of broth, to incorporate all dry ingredients; I roasted sweet potatoes for soup, then used part of them in puree for this recipe, and maybe didn't make it moist enough to work right by itself... for the broth, I used 2 tsp Old Bay, 1 Tbsp   1 tsp salt, 1-1/2 Tbsp Atlantic kelp granules, and six 1x3 strips of nori (the sheets you roll sushi in), with the recommended 8 cups of water. I pulsed the broth in batches in the blender, to incorporate the nori... the result smelled just like shrimp broth while it was cooking-- really brought back holiday memories! :-) I didn't do slices of dough, just pulled off 1/2-1 pieces and rolled them into unshrimpy balls... after boiling, I tossed them in seasoned flour/ cornstarch and pan-fried, then drizzled with fresh lemon juice/ served with spicy cocktail sauce: YUM!! I'll try this recipe again, and flatten/ slice the dough instead-- the boiled-only shrimpy balls (the way I did it) were too soft to eat or use in recipes 'as-is', but great fried... I'm guessing that's 'cause I changed the prep method a little; oh well, guess I'd better try it again! (and again, and again, etc etc etc!)

Rather than measuring carefully, I just dumped 3 or 4 T. mayo, a heaping tsp. of dijon, a little Italian parsley and 2 big basil leaves in a mini- processor and twirled it a few times.  (That was more than enough spread for 2 extra-large sandwiches.) I used smoked turkey, bacon and Swiss, and brushed the bread with olive oil.  The only way I really deviated from the recipe was by adding about a tsp. of hot pepper relish to each serving for a little kick.  My son took one bite, muttered, Killer!  Absolutely killer! -- and then didn't come up for air again until he'd devoured every crumb.  Can't wait wntil tomatoes are in season.  That will add yet another layer of yumminess.

I saw this recipe in Martha's magazine and had to make it! It was a bit time consuming, but do-able (a little less work than lasagna). I used Martha's crepe recipe and it took me awhile to remember the technique in using my electric crepe maker! The only hitch in the recipe was that I did not have enough sauce to spread on 12 crepes (only 8), so I had to stop building my crepe tower, and it was not quite as tall as I'd have liked. I was thinking of potential shortcuts in the future and using Knorr's pkg. alfredo sauce would save some time. Since my stack was a bit short, I felt it only served 3 adults (2 pieces each) but maybe with the addt. crepe it would serve 6. I am seriously considering this for a vegetarian dinner for company coming up next month!  The result was FABULOUS, melting in your mouth, and worth the effort.
