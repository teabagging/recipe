For anyone who hasn't tried this yet, this recipe is NOT something that some dimwit like me just threw together -- there is a LOT of thought and science within this elegant dish. Does it look too complicated to prepare? Yes. Is it difficult to make? Absolutely not! Just follow the instructions as they are given. It's all stovetop and the roast comes out plenty tender. Now, I will issue a WARNING to unsuspecting chefs: When you pour 2 cups of tequila into a hot pan, one of those two cups is chemically PURE ALCOHOL and quite flammable. Be ready for this! I anticipated big flames and all I had to do is to have a wet dish towel ready to smother the flames (three feet flames at one point!). When you DEGLAZE, add the tequila a little at a time! That way, when the fire starts, it won't burn long and these will be small (4-6 inch) flames. The big flames come when you pour in the bulk of the tequila. Also, deglaze from the side unless you want your hands dehaired. If you think that the fire is too much at some point (alcohol fire is not nearly as hot as normal fires -- I let it burn for 10 seconds), just calmly lay the wet towel completely over the pan and it will go out. If you have an exhaust fan over your stove (I don't), have it on before you deglaze. The fire might re-ignite for a couple of minutes until the alcohol dissipates, but you can just repeat the towel thing easily. Now, enough of fire -- the flavor of this roast is incredible! Most pork loin roasts don't taste like much of anything -- too lean. That is not the case with this recipe. Lots of great flavor. Don't be put off by the peanut butter sauce either -- I'm not a peanut butter fan but the blend of it with the dry mustard is sheer perfection. If you want to impress the heck out of somebody, make this dish and they certainly will be!

The texture of the zucchini was really good, better than another zucchini lasagna that I've made. To accomplish the folding over of the lasagna noodles (step 9), which I was really confused about when I read the recipe, this is what I did: I took 4 noodles, put them side-by-side along the longest sides of the pan. To get them to hang over the sides I started all 4 of them in the middle of the pan, so half of each noodle was hanging over the side, and got 4 more noodles on the other side, starting in the middle.  So there were 8 noodles on the first layer, not overlapping, but hanging half over the sides. Then for the second layer I put 3 lasanga noodles side-by-side going the opposite way of the other noodles, like a normal lasagna, along the longest length of the pan. Then for the top I folded over the hanging noodles. It really worked great.

I eat ham and bacon just nothing 'pork' (chops, roasts, etc) But when I found this recipe (being a tequila lover) I was intrigued...so giving my SO a coronary I asked for a pork roast to make for dinner today and showed this recipe. SO was leary of it until I said I would eat it...Just finished dinner...I ate my first pork roast in about 35 years! AND IT WAS AWESOME! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didnt have a roast that big so I scaled back a little on the ingredients. I had no problem withthe tequila (no fire at all) as I added it slowly to a very large pan. Served with 'smashed' potatos and lima beans. Sliced thin it was tender (fork cutable) and very juicy and although everyone was afraid of the mustard/peanut butter/ horseradish/worchester sauce slurry...everyone thought the taste was incredible the 'weird ingredients' combined to produce an incredible sauce!

They were soooo good that I may not even bother with using the sauce.  I might just make a gravy to serve on the side for my DH who likes gravy on rice and potatoes.  He will be happy and so will I.  I will just eat them plain as cooked without any sauce.  Yes, they are that good!  In fact I find the flavor in most meatballs lacking in flavor.  NOT these!

I used sliced blanched almonds for the mixed nuts but I can see chopped pistachios looking nice on top with their green colour.

Really preferred it this way, no chunks of chiles but still with the flavor.  Also, used 75% reduced fat Cabot cheese.  AWESOME.  4/12/07 Made this and wow!

I made two separate batches of the peppers.  For the first batch i followed the instructions but did not cook them in the oven, I prepared and stuffed the peppers then put them in a rubbermaid freezer container without the parmesan cheese or paprika.  After two days i removed them from the freezer and put them in a 9x9 square baking pan.  I put approx 1/3 inch of water and covered tightly with aluminum foil.  I baked them at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes i removed the foil and sprinkled the parmesan cheese and paprika on top and baked for another 10 minutes.  They were delicious!  For the second batch i prepared the recipe and cooked them.  After cooking them i took two of the peppers and froze them in a Rubbermaid container as well.  After two days i removed them and put them in an 8x8 baking pan with a 1/4 cup of water.  I covered and sealed the peppers with aluminum foil and baked at 325 degrees for about 45 minutes.  They did hold up well.  If I did have a choice in the future on which way to freeze them I would do it the first way.  Prepare the peppers and freeze before cooking.  The texture of the pepper was much better.  Anytime you freeze a pepper it will get soggy and sometimes the skin separates from the pulp of the pepper and isn't very appealing, but cooking it after freezing did prevent alot of that.    I definately would recommend this recipe.  I am not a vegetarian but it was delicious and a great way to get all your vegetables in your daily diet.  You could also double the recipe easily and freeze half for another night before cooking.

Did the procedure like fairy nuff. I got overexcited with my Aussie goodies, that I just had to try them! When I made this, near the end stage, I divided it into two. The first one was as is.

Then I incorporated it with the half loaf mixture then made small buns out of it. Boy, the one with additional ingredients smells a tad bit like chocolate after it was done without tasting like chocolate.   After baking it in the oven, both had a crusty outside, but inside's soft. They're also nice to look at when they're sliced- few scattered dots of wattleseeds. It's also nutty. Tastewise, the 1st is simpler, subtler while the 2nd was upped a bit coz of the added aroma. But they're pretty much the same tastewise. We've nearly finished it all and it's still hard to recognize the difference except for the smell, and since the first wasn't formed into buns, it was softer too. I tried it with vegemite..ewww.. lol It was nice with honey but we preferred it with Recipe #373737 and Spanish chorizo. Gosh- great accompaniment!

I was really torn on how to rate it.  I finally came to the conclusion of 5 stars for two reasons...it is a GREAT basic recipe, and as you pointed out yourself, it is so versitile!  This is my rationale.  First, I had no celery, so I sub'd 2 TBSP. celery seeds.  Second, I am a high fibre, high protein person, so I added about 7 oz. white beans to the recipe.  Bottom line is that though it was not the greatest recipe/dish I have ever eaten, I did have to give high marks on nutrition, ease to prepare, and versitility(oh, I also used mixed frozen peas/carrots, as that's what I had).  Let me say, it's a keeper.  For parents who want to get more fibre in their kid's diets, the white beans were superior!  If they are slightly crushed, you don't even know they are in the recipe, as they are the same color as the dish itself.  Again, looking at your own statement of versitility, I began in my mind mixing salsa, sweet red pepper chunks, green chilis, and (again)beans into the mixture.  Oh, my!  I almost made another dish just thinking of the possibilities.  With such a small amount of the GOOD protein of tuna/salmon and beans, my head began to reel.  With cream cheese replacing the part or all of the other cheeses, this could be a SUPER warm dip for tortillas.  Well, I guess enough rambling, 'cus the point is that any imaginitive cook could turn this recipe into MANY different nutritious and CHEAP meals.  It's truly a winner, and hit my KEEP file forever.  BTW, after lunch today, there was only one serving left...into the freezer baggie with some leftover cauliflaur for another upcoming meal.  Oops!  Forgot one other thing....I used a dead bag of potato chips on the topping since they were mostly crumbs anyway, and it's a personal preference of mine...other additions that came to mind were diced fresh tomatoes, snow peas, edemame, brocolli, diced turnip, sauteed mushrooms, and the list just goes on.

I have another bag of apples and I'm going to try cooking this for a lot longer this time (did 12 hours with the 2nd batch), or just leave it on high the whole time to see if it will thicken up more.  Overall, I love the flavour (like apple pie) and have lots of jars to give away at Christmas!  Ooohh, I just thought about serving it hot over vanilla ice cream -- yum!  \\n\\nBy the way, after peeling and coring the apples, I chopped them in the food processor in batches of about 3-4 apples at a time.  Also, not being accustomed to the whole canning thing, I heated the jars in the dishwasher, then put them back in after filling them (during the heat dry cycle).  The ones whose lids didn't pop went into the freezer where they popped soon thereafter, so perhaps I could have skipped the final hot process and gone straight to the freezer.  I assume they can then go back onto the pantry shelf after the lids have popped."},{"name":"balsamic blueberries and peaches","steps":"in a 1 to 1 1 / 2 quart heavy saucepan , bring 3 tablespoons sugar with vinegar and 1 cup of the blueberries to a boil while stirring constantly', 'boil 1 minute', 'remove from heat', 'combine remaining 2 cups of blueberries with peach slices in a large bowl', 'toss with hot blueberry syrup and black pepper', 'add additional sugar , if desired', 'let stand 30 minutes , tossing occasionally'","description":"found on epicurious.com.  sounds like a unique twist to me...........  used for zwt 3 with midwest and south as the regions, blueberries in michigan and peaches in georgia.","ingredients":"sugar', 'balsamic vinegar', 'blueberries', 'peach', 'black pepper'","review":"Thank you for helping me use up my older apples, this is a scrumptious recipe.

I did stir it every few hours, even leaving the top off for a couple hours to get it to not be so liquidy.  The house smelled amazing!  I also couldn't find any cloves so I used a tsp of nutmeg instead.  To can it and seal it (to give one jar away), I used the inversion method.  Look it up because it's so much easier than boiling.

On a side note, for those making the recipe; put your cores and peelings into a large pot with ample water and boil them while you are doing the apples.  Let them &quot;brew&quot; for a good hour or more, keeping plenty of water in the pan.  Strain the juice and use it for jelly, then use the peeling and &quot;mush&quot; to make fruit leather.

Minor changes I made: peeled apples and, separately, placed peel and chopped apples in food processor. Wanted to preserve nutrients of the skin. Cooked on high 3 hours, decreased to low for 4. Placed in blender and pur&eacute;ed until smooth. Poured back into crockpot uncovered for 1 hour. Unfortunately I didn&#039;t cook overnight and needed it done before my bedtime - only reason for time/temp change, but it tastes amazing."},{"name":"balsamic glazed brussels sprouts","steps":"preheat oven to 425', 'combine brussels sprouts and onion in medium bowl with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil , salt and pepper , tossing gently', 'spread on lightly greased baking sheet', 'roast 25 to 30 minutes or until vegetables are tender and caramelized', 'meanwhile , saute shallot in remaining olive oil in small skillet over medium high heat 5 minutes or until tender', 'add balsamic vinegar and cook 5 minutes more', 'stir in rosemary and pour over sprouts'","description":"not sure how i acquired this recipe. i love brussels sprouts, and this is a great way to prepare them....so easy too!!","ingredients":"fresh brussels sprouts', 'red onion', 'olive oil', 'kosher salt', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'shallot', 'balsamic vinegar', 'fresh rosemary'","review":"I won&#039;t rate this because I changed the recipe by using 1/2 of the amount of sugar called for.

This was great and they turned out sooo beautiful.  This is how I altered this recipe to fit my ingredients:  I didn't have a package of yeast, so I used 2 and 1/4 teaspoons of yeast for the breadmaker, and Gold Medal 'Better for Bread' flour.  I used my Bread Machine and added the ingredients starting with the warm milk, melted butter, sugar, beaten egg and salt; then, I added the 4 cups of bread flour.  Next, I made an indentation in the flour and poured the yeast mixture into it.  Set my bread machine for 'dough' and let it go until after it had risen the first time.  I punched the dough down, took it out and made the round shapes for the pan.  I made sure I had plenty of flour on my fingers while shaping the rolls.  This recipe actually made 13 'extremely' large rolls that were absolutely delicious!  I think next time, though, I will make 26 rolls by making the shapes smaller.  Baking time was perfect.  I brushed butter on the top of the rolls after they came out of the oven for flavor, but it is optional.

I added at least 1.5 cups while my Kitchenaid was mixing this and I was still adding when I did a little bit of hand kneading at the end. <br/><br/>The verdict: Texturally, these were great. I was (apparently unnecessarily) worried about all of the extra flour. Flavor-wise, they need a little something more. I think next time I make these, I'll try buttermilk instead. It would have helped if I had remembered salted butter for the table too. I haven't been to Lambert's in at least 5 years but I'm willing to say these are comparable to their rolls.

My husband picked strawberries on Saturday, and withn 2 days, I had made this delectable soup 4 times, as I just couldn't get enough of it. I think this soup would taste great even as a dessert. When I was preparing this soup for the first time, I reduced the ingredients to make it a serving for one person, and when I needed to add the pineapple juice, I added the juice from a can of crushed pineapple, and later when making the soup again, I ended up adding some of the crushed pineapple, which worked great in the soup. I did however, add 1 tablespoon of sugar per each serving I had made; especially since the pineapple juice is a bit tart. Also, I subbed vanilla yogurt for the strawberry yogurt, and when it came to adding the ice, I added 2 mini ice cubes per each serving.
