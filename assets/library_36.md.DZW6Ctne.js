I used fresh hamburger, dried it well before putting in the skillet, and I cooked it on high, so that I could truly get a &quot;browning.&quot; Then I carmelized the onions, and added lots of extra garlic (maybe 5-6 cloves).

I took a big chance and decided to use your recipe for slow cooker mashed potatoes and I must say I am SO happy that I did! I used my 5-qt oval crockpot and found that the 5 lbs of potatoes did not fit, so I used about 4 pounds instead - but left the rest of the recipe the same. Because some reviewers stated that their potatoes weren't fully cooked, I started mine on LOW half an hour early and then switched to high for 4 hours and 15 minutes. They cooked perfectly, from the top of the crockpot to the bottom. I smashed them with a potato masher, not an electric mixer, and added warm half & half and just whipped them with a fork. I joked to my husband that I hoped he liked his potatoes with a few lumps, but in the end they were smooth and creamy as can be. I left them on the WARM setting until our turkey was done and they were just perfect and delicious. What a delightfully stress-free way to make hot mashed potatoes on a holiday! It couldn't have been easier - especially since hubby peeled all the potatoes - he said he felt like he was in the Army again, LOL!  I am never going to boil my potatoes again. I plan to make a big batch of mashed potatoes in the crockpot once a week to use all week for meals. I stumbled across your recipe by accident while looking for something else and I am so glad that I did - they were DELICIOUS!

So glad I did.  The recipe calls for way too much salt.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes.  It took 4.5 hours to get them to the right softness for mashing and they tasted more roasted than mashed.  When it came time to mash it looked like a horrible mess.  Eventually it came together and the consistency was ok.  The potatoes had a roasted/yellowish hue.  The flavour was too salty and slightly gluey.  \\n\\nWhen it came to Christmas day I changed things up after a lot of research on the making of potatoes in the slow cooker.  First, I soaked the peeled potatoes for 30 minutes, then rinsed them twice to ensure all starch was off the potatoes.  I filled the crock pot to the top (we had a big crowd).  I used 3 c. of water and 1 c. of chicken broth (next time I would use another cup or two of liquid for the amount of potatoes I had).  I did not add salt (the broth has it in it) or garlic, butter or pepper to ensure that this was not causing the discoloring.  I roasted garlic separate and added it with the butter and milk  later.  I placed a piece of parchment paper over the top of the potatoes and tucked the edges along the sides of the crock pot.  This prevented the top edges of the potatoes from browning.  After 4.5 hours this large pot was not yet done (just another minor Christmas crisis (thank god for microwaves).  If you are doing this amount you are going to need about 5-6 hours.  After they were done, I drained the potatoes and rinsed them again - mashing with the water and starch would have just made gluey potatoes - I like milk in my potatoes.  They stayed wonderfully warm in the slow cooker.  \\n\\nThank you for sharing your idea.  I really like the concept and am so happy I tried it.

I need to divulge my tweaks, since I read the reviews. I left out the garlic powder and added one bag of roasted garlic cloves - maybe 8 or 10 chopped cloves. I used half the butter and double the water, as some others suggested. I didn't measure the salt or pepper, but pretty sure it was less than some added, as they had reviewed that it was too salty. I figured I could always add more at the end. But, I cooked the potatoes for 4 hours on high. I removed 1/2 cup of water (I'd added an extra cup). I ended up using only 1/2 cup milk and mashed by hand. The potatoes were wonderful! The flavoring is dictated by the amounts and types of garlic, butter, salt, and pepper you use. Adjust those to your preferences. However, the process design of using the crockpot... sheer brilliance. I no longer have to worry about boiling at the last moment or mashing even later. I can let the crockpot do the work, mash early, and work on other stuff.

While the meat was cooking (two batches at 5 minutes each), I prepared the romaine and tomatoes.  I used the romaine for a deliciously gluten-free meal and DH used flour tortillas.  We both were in love with the flavor of this recipe, especially the squeeze of lime on top.  That's a must!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Tina!

First, I used the largest crockpot I had - the giant one and not all the ingredients would fit and that was after I put less of a couple items in. I do think there is a mistake in the amount of meatballs, no way would you use 96 ounces of meatballs, one package of 32 ounces was almost too many meatballs. Second, without any spices this could have been a very bland recipe, I added some garlic, some Italian spice and some bay leaf and basil and it still needed more spice. I am thinking next time adding a few chili peppers. This makes a huge amount of soup way beyond 10 servings. We have enough soup for several meals, I had to remove some of the liquid from the crockpot to add the noodles.I did substitute turkey meatballs as I don't eat red meat and that substitution worked fine.

So after bathing the meat in the mix, I wrap it up and place in fridge over night and it really lets that flavor sink in before going into the crock pot. So then next morning, I put in meat first then put my veggies around it and and put 1/2 cup of water that I boiled 1 beef cube in from the microwave. I used less water because the roast will make plenty of juice on its own. (tip: why potatoes get mush so fast or your roast is more soupy... gross) Dont worry about adding soup mix to veggies, I only put it on the meat because the meat juices will season the veggies. (thats why I rub the seasoning deep into the meat.) Such a better taste too. I usually cook my roast on low for 8-9 hours because I do it while I am at work. By the time I get home its so tender and juicy and the meat falls apart on it own, I have never had an issue with the veggies being too soft or too hard. Oh!!!- And another huge tip: cook your roast upside down. Put the most fatty part on top because the fat is where the juice comes from so if its upside down then the juice cook down into the meat for the most flavor."},{"name":"real deal pralines","steps":"mix sugar , corn syrup , condensed milk , and water thoroughly', cook over a low fire until the soft-boil stage , it'll say on your candy thermometer, 'remove from heat', 'add butter , vanilla , and pecans', 'beat until the mixture holds its shape', 'spoon onto buttered wax paper , and allow to cool', 'enjoy !'","description":"even though i grew up eating these i never can seem to make them! i can make gourmet dinners and desserts but i can't make pralines or bread!! but i got this recipe from the justin wilson website and it's as authentic as you can get. good luck!!","ingredients":"sugar', 'corn syrup', 'condensed milk', 'water', 'butter', 'vanilla', 'pecan halves'","review":"Great Recipe!

I can see that I'm going to have to put another one together real soon -- AND IT'S SO DARN EASY ON TOP OF IT ALL!!! UPDATE:  I love blueberries, so decided to make a blueberry pie using this recipe.  It is fabulous.  I used a bag of frozen blueberries -- but realized I wouldn't have the juice I needed.  So I picked up a can of blueberries and had plenty of juice (although there was added sugar to it -- not ideal for hubby).  I think with all the blueberries I used, they were probably equivilant to about 3 cans of cherries.  I didn't use any food coloring and did not add the almond extract --but did increase the lemon juice from 2 teaspoons to 3 teaspoons.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I was originally starting out to make Beer Bread Recipe #73440, but there were a lot of complaints with that one being too heavy and too sweet; so after comparing other recipes to it, I decided to go with this one, which essentially adjusts those concerns - uses less flour, less sugar.<br/><br/>I didn't have self-rising flour, so I had to add 1 tsp of salt and 2.5 tsp baking powder. I sifted the flour directly into the measuring cup, so as to avoid it being packed at all; and the bread was light and fluffy, actually closer in texture to a yeast bread than a quick bread. <br/><br/>When adding the beer to the dry ingredients, the rising action began immediately; so I quickly stirred it just enough to get everything moistened. It was fun to watch, as the bread actually rose while the oven was preheating - would've risen further had I given it a few more minutes, which I will next time. <br/><br/>Bread was light textured inside, slightly crusty outside, about the same sweetness as any white bread (i.e. not noticeably sweet), smelled/tasted slightly of beer but so slightly that no one knew there was beer in it until I told them.  <br/>It was a bit crumbly when cutting, difficult to get a a perfect slice; but that's the case with most of my breads :^) so that really wasn't an issue for us.  I think we liked this bread at least as well as many homemade yeast breads - and given the level of effort involved, no contest.  <br/><br/>Read more: http://www.food.com/recipe/lazy-irish-beer-bread-14988#ixzz1HD0ITxVi"},{"name":"really  really good  and easy   buttercream frosting","steps":"put butter , milk , and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer', 'mix on low speed until it just starts to come together , about a minute', 'scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula', 'increase to medium low speed and beat for about another minute', 'increase mixer speed to medium high and beat for about another or minute or so', 'add powdered sugar', 'beat on low speed until sugar is just barely incorporated', 'scrape down the sides of the bowl , and increase speed slowly to medium', 'beat for about a minute', 'check your consistency', 'this is very important because if your frosting is too thick , it will not spread well', 'if your spatula does not glide through the frosting , add about a tablespoon of corn syrup and beat on medium for about 30 seconds', 'when the frosting is just holding its shape , it is too thick', 'add another tablespoon of corn syrup and beat on medium for 30 seconds', 'repeat until the frosting seems to be of a good spreadable consistency', 'once you get your frosting to a good , spreadable consistency , increase mixer speed to medium high and beat for one minute', 'this will get your frosting nice and fluffy'","description":"first off, i have to give all credit to the confessions of a cookbook queen blog, because that's where i found this recipe. it is the best country (non-cook) buttercream frosting that i have ever had. if you're decorating a cake or cupcakes, it also holds up well. i guessed on the yield, but this recipe will easily frost 24 cupcakes.","ingredients":"salted butter', 'powdered sugar', 'vanilla', 'milk', 'corn syrup', 'unsweetened cocoa powder'","review":"You can't get much easier than this!

It was a very rainy day so I weighed my (self-rising) flour, 12.5 ounces = 2 1/2 Cups. I used an extra pale pilsner (Rolling Rock). I realized I had left my trusted loaf pan at our beach house, so I had to use a very &quot;tinny&quot; loaf pan. I was afraid the bottom of the bread may burn with the pan I had, so I decided to bake it on an insulated sheet pan. After 30 minutes, I brushed about 3 Tablespoons of melted butter over the top. I baked and additional 15 - 18 minutes and it was a beautiful loaf of bread. Very light, not overly dense at all. I served it along side of http://kittencalskitchen.com/2009/10/09/ground-beef-and-barley-soup/ and Holy Cow, it was a comfort meal from heaven. Even though I do not like a stout or dark beer, DH does. Next time I make this I will used a beer such as Guinness and serve with a proper Irish stew. I will also fore-go the butter (or use a lesser amount of unsalted butter)for a more sweet bread(maybe a little more sugar as well?). I can&#039;t wait to make this again using a darker beer!

I used a sesame oil (1 teaspoon in non-stick skillet) in keeping with the Asian taste of the soy sauce.  I also used a lite, firm tofu (packed in water, not silken).

After soaking the beans overnight you are supposed to boil them just until the skin cracks on the beans when you blow on them. They reach this stage like 2 minutes of boiling, yet the beans are still hard as a rock.

I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written, yet here it is 5 hours later and the beans are still swimming in a soupy liquid.  I even raised the temperature to 300 degrees about an hour ago and no change. I was very much looking forward to some proper baked beans but I guess that won&#039;t be happening this time. Perhaps the recipe could be changed to describe how long one should boil the beans, or what consistency they are supposed to be at certain stages. These were a disaster.

I might just make this again tonight!"},{"name":"red currant   raspberry jelly","steps":"using a potato masher , crush currants in a very large stainless steel or enamel saucepan', 'add water& bring to a boil over high heat', 'reduce heat , cover& boil gently for 10 minutes', 'add raspberries , return to a boil& boil gently for 3 minutes', 'strain mixture through a coarse sieve , pressing pulp to extract juice& discarding the solids', if you want , you can now pour the juice through a jelly bag - i'm lazy& don't do this !, you should have 4 cups of juice - when i don't get that amount , i top up with cranberry cocktail - combine juice with sugar in a very large stainless steel or enamel saucepan, 'bring to a boil& boil hard , stirring constantly , for 1 minute', 'remove from heat , stir in pectin& ladle into sterilized jars , leaving 1 / 2 inch head space', 'be sure to remove any air bubbles', 'place jars into boiling water in canner , add enough water to cover lids by 2 inches& return to boil', 'boil for 5 minutes', 'remove from canner , cool , label& store in cool , dark place'","description":"i first tried this recipe from the complete book of small batch preserving when i discovered a red currant bush in our garden. we get so many berries from the bush that i freeze them & make this jelly all year round. my grandchildren don't want store-bought jam anymore!","ingredients":"red currants', 'water', 'raspberries', 'granulated sugar', 'liquid fruit pectin'","review":"This was just excellent.
