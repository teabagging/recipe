I bought an 8-inch springform pan at a local restaurant supply store. The vesica piscis-shaped (double pointed oval) tins like the one pictured in the recipe link proved too expensive for a first trial bake. I enjoyed this baking adventure and my guests enjoyed the outcome at dinner, but I learned a few lessons from the recipe worth sharing. The author cautioned readers about keeping the pastry dough warm. I followed her advice by creating a double boiler with small pans set on the smallest eye of my gas stove at the lowest heat setting. But the side of my pastry in contact with the top pan dried out from the heat. This created cracks in my pastry sheets during the bake. With proper timing, warming the dough in a pan isn't necessary. The ground pork and bacon also presented a problem during the bake. The high fat content of these ingredients released a lot of moisture which built up behind and leaked from cracks in walls of the pastry. Leaner game meat would not have released this much moisture. If I use these same ingredients again, I might render and drain their fat before incorporating them into the pie filling. The final lesson learned centered around the gelatin which did not make it into the pie. The pie requires 26+ hours to prepare with most of that time reserved for cooling. I tried pouring my gelatin into the pie, but the fluid passed through the warm filling and out the cracks in the side of my pastry. Had I started my bake the night before and allowed sufficient time to chill, the gelatin would have congealed when poured into the pie. I could have avoided this issue with a closer reading of the recipe."},{"name":"my berry smoothie","steps":"mix and enjoy !', 'i also sometimes add frozen raspberries', this is just one serving for me - it's a big one , with about 300 calories, my time on making it can be up to 10 minutes , but i don't have a regular blender, 'so your time may be much less'","description":"i read some smoothie recipes here, and then modified it to something that i really like (my first try didn't work so well, but this is so healthy and it's like 5 servings of fruit for the day)!","ingredients":"plain nonfat yogurt', 'banana', 'orange juice', 'frozen strawberries', 'frozen blueberries', 'sugar'","review":"Excellent all around.

I mixed some walnut oil into the veg oil for extra flavour (about 1/4 of the oil), and did add the cinnamon.\\nThanks for a great recipe!"},{"name":"my delightful quinoa casserole","steps":"add stock , quinoa , squash and seasonings to a medium saucepan', 'bring ingredients to boil', 'cover and simmer 15 minutes , or until liquid is absorbed', 'preheat oven to 350 degrees', 'fold in 6 oz of cheese and spinach , transfer to an oven-safe casserole dish', 'sprinkle remaining cheese on top', 'bake for 30 minutes', 'enjoy !'","description":"this is an extremely filling dish that includes the amazing grain quinoa!","ingredients":"quinoa', 'vegetable stock', 'butternut squash', 'baby spinach', 'sharp cheddar cheese', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'oregano', 'black pepper', 'kosher salt'","review":"This is a great recipe.

i live in a state that can easily be a 100 degrees for days on end during the summer and you know what butter does on hot days.  it melts!  a greasy puddle of melted icing on a cake plate is not something i want to look at or eat.  \\n\\nyour top notch decorators have a few options we don‚Äôt.  they have huge refrigerators to store their cakes in, and refrigerated vehicles that they can use to deliver decorated cakes. i even know a few that refuse to deliver at all. if you want their cake, you come and get it and it‚Äôs your responsibility if it melts.  these decorators don‚Äôt even turn on their ovens for a wedding cake for less than $2000.  \\n\\nthe following recipes for buttercream icing hold up pretty well in the heat and humidity, but if you know that your cake will be out in very high temperatures, then don‚Äôt use any butter and use only a high quality shortening.  \\n\\nshortening:  \\n\\nsolid shortenings definitely have their place in baking. so i‚Äôm going to talk taste tests. crisco is the hands down winner. it has a clean taste with the melting point of 106 degrees. butter melts somewhere between 88 and 98 degrees f. depending on the amount of fat in the brand.  you can see that if you need to serve a pure buttercream decorated cake, on a hot august afternoon, you could have melted roses (and i do mean greasy puddles) on the tablecloth. this is when a good quality shortening will be a great blessing. i have been told by decorator friends that some of the warehouse brand shortenings leave a grainy consistency to the icing no matter what you do.  \\n\\npowdered (confectioner's) sugar:  \\n\\nregarding powdered sugar. please use a cane sugar. i prefer c&h powdered (confectioners) sugar.  many of the cheaper brands use sugar beets for their base.  i don‚Äôt know the chemistry behind it but you definitely get different textures to your icing that can vary from batch to batch.  i spent a few months being very frustrated with the quality of my icing until a kind lady did a bit of trouble shooting for me. she recommended the cane sugar and i‚Äôve been blessing her ever since.\\n\\ntop-quality brands:  \\n\\nplease be safe, buy a quality brands and then stick with it for the best results. a friend of mine, who is a wonderful cook and baker, travels a lot and she often prepares treats for her hosts. she‚Äôs learned to ask the host to have her favorite shortening and flour on hand. she has even made up a little makeup type case that carries her favorite extracts and precious spices. that way she knows what she is working with, how it handles, and what tastes she can expect for the finished product. some surprises are not pleasant. \\n\\nstoring buttercream icing: \\n\\nif you are not going to be using the icing right away, place it in a clean, sealable bowl. store it in the refrigerator but please don‚Äôt place it next to the marinating salmon, garlic or broccoli.  you do not want those flavors in your icing!  i like to use my icing within a few days but it will hold in the cold refrigerator for a couple of weeks if necessary.  \\n\\ni often make a double batch of icing the night before i have a baking project.  that way i know that i have plenty of icing, it‚Äôs fresh and i don‚Äôt have to make it while i‚Äôm in the middle of baking the cakes.  the extra can always be used for a batch of cupcakes.\\n\\nwhen you remove the icing from the refrigerator, you might notice that the icing has taken on a sponge like texture. do yourself a favor and place the icing in a bowl and mix by hand using a back and forth, smashing motion with a spoon or icing spatula. what you want to do is to smash the bubbles out of the icing. this extra step will help to give you the smoothest icing for a pretty top and sides of the cake. i have found that you will get an even better texture of icing if it is at room temperature before you try to do your icing.\\n\\nbad buttercream icing days:  \\n\\none thing that seems very silly but is true. there are bad buttercream days! i‚Äôve asked quite a few decorators about this and every one says ‚Äúyes, there are lousy days? i‚Äôm not sure what causes the problem. \\n\\nit could be that every human has bad days so they blame the buttercream. \\n\\nit may be the humidity or that there is a low pressure system hanging over your town. \\n\\ni just know why but it is a perceived fact. the way i have handled the problem is that i changed the decoration on the cake.  i couldn‚Äôt get the smooth top or sides as i originally planned. writing a greeting on a messy top would look awful so i changed the design idea and put flowers everywhere. i could have also done a basket weave technique around the sides. just go with the flow, and don‚Äôt get frustrated. aunt martha won‚Äôt chuck the cake at you if you don‚Äôt write her name on the top this time. remember that you are creating something that is to be eaten so have fun with it.  \\n\\ndifferent mixers:\\n\\nif you have a heavy duty counter mixer, you can prepare a whole batch at one time.  if you are using a hand mixer, divide the recipe in half.  if you notice the mixer getting hot, please stop and let the machine cool off.\\n\\ni also prefer to mix the buttercream on a low setting. it seems that the higher setting do the job faster but you also will get a spongy texture to the icing. i don‚Äôt want that quality in my final ice coating or flowers on the cake. \\n\\nusing weight scales:\\n\\n1 cup of crisco weighs 6 ounces.  \\n\\ni put a piece of wax paper on my scale and start plopping spoons of shortening on until i get the desired weight. it really saves on the cleanup.  \\n\\n\\n\\nrecipe from peggy at whatscookingamerica.net","ingredients":"butter', 'crisco shortening', 'butter flavoring', 'pure vanilla extract', 'almond extract', confectioners' sugar, 'salt', 'meringue powder', 'water'","review":"This was supposed to be for dinner but I ended up snacking on this as it's so good minus the excess calories.

I love how easy this pie comes together. The cream cheese in the whipped cream really gives a nice subtle cheesecake cake taste to the pie.

Not as spicy as traditional pumpkin pie and has a much creamier texture - so people  who are not fans of traditional pumpkin pie would love this recipe.

I thought that was so cool, and so did all the baby shower guests. The look lasted for about 45 minutes and then the ice cream did kind of disintegrate and not look as pleasant. It still tasted fine. 3) I did make changes to the recipe. I left out the Pina Colada mix. I made one Kool-aid packet for the punch and froze the other prepared packet in ice cube trays.

Let me say that I did make some subs- I used 9oz whole wheat pastry flour instead of AP, used about 3/4 turbanado sugar and 1/4 Sucanat, and used soymilk instead of milk.  Still terrific.  It turned out very tender with a delightful buttery flavor.  I originally had planned to make this with Lime, Orange or Lemon Curd recipe #41567(we made lemon curd), but we ate all the curd before I got around to making this.  So, I didn't have any curd to top it with it, but I still really enjoyed it.  The lemon flavor in the loaf is fairly mild- I would say it is about equal with the caraway flavor.  All the spices balance incredibly well.  I like using lots of spices and love recipes that use them in unusual way.  As I was eating, I kept thinking that the caraway might be a bit too strong, but it really does go very well.  It rose beautifully and is a very pretty loaf.  I forgot to flour my pan, but it still came out just fine.  I did cut mine with a serrated bread knife, but found that it was not too tender to the point of falling apart.  I had no problem cutting very thin or quite thick pieces.  Either way, though, this cake really melts in your mouth and is bursting with unusual flavor.  I really appreciated that this wasn't too sweet.  We enjoyed it for breakfast, but for something special I am sure that the recommended lemon curd would make this just great.  Really enjoyed this.

(it took me a long time to realize that this recipe was not the norm, and that many other people make flatter, crisper sugar cookies!) you can frost them as you wish. i make a buttercream icing for mine. if there is any drawback to these at all, it's that the dough gets a little sticky so it really must be chilled well to be rollable. both the dough and finished (unfrosted) cookies freeze well. sometimes i use almond extract instead of vanilla. bear in mind that these puff up quite a bit so simple cookie cutter shapes work best. prep time includes chill time.","ingredients":"sugar', 'butter', 'baking powder', 'flour', 'vanilla', 'eggs', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'sour cream'","review":"This cake worked out fine, but I had to make quite a few adjustments. First, when I was part way through the recipe, I noticed milk mentioned in the steps but not the ingredients. I had to improvise so I added just enough milk to make what I thought looked like a good thickness of batter, about 2 tablespoons. Then I realised the amount of batter was not nearly enough to fill a 9-10 inch pan (maybe a result of not knowing how much milk to use), so I used an 8 inch pan. I only ended up using about half the pears, and that did two layers over the cake. Finally, the melted butter mixture proved to be way too much for the cake. I only got about half of it on, before it overflowed the pan. I poured a bit off and baked for another twenty minutes, which worked fine. As I said, the end result was actually a pleasing cake but I think that was more down to a bit of luck and baking experience (so I could improvise) than the directions here.
