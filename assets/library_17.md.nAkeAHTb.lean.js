I wonder if there is a mistake in the ingredient list. Only change I made was to use the entire filling recipe in just one pie shell. Otherwise, it would have been less than half full. One cup of molasses completely overpowered the pie, and with the sugar was way too sugary sweet.

Despite the 2 star review, I took a chance with the recipe. I cut 5 chicken breast halves into strips, and continued with the recipe.For the creole seasoning, Recipe#232949 was used.I do agree with the previous poster about the seasoning, needs just a bit more of the creole but nothing more. Instead of deep frying, the strips were pan fried in vegetable oil over medium heat. This will be made again, but next time with more seasoning.

(pasquil's palin, 1619).\\ntossing pancakes -\\ncertainly these days part of the fun of cooking pancakes is in the tossing. to toss a pancake successfully takes a combination of the perfect pancake and good technique - it's so easy to get it wrong and end up with half the pancake still stuck to the pan while the other half is stuck to the ceiling or floor. all in all, it's probably best to practise a few times without an audience.\\npancake races - \\nin the uk, pancake races also form an important part of the shrove tuesday celebrations - an opportunity for large numbers of people to race down the streets tossing pancakes. \\nmardi gras - \\nthe french name (literally fat tuesday ) for shrove tuesday has been given to a number of mardi gras carnivals around the world. among the most famous are those of rio de janeiro and new orleans","ingredients":"plain flour', 'eggs', '1% low-fat milk', 'salt', 'butter', 'fresh lemon', 'caster sugar'","review":"I came across this recipe earlier this year from another site.

I really enjoyed the addition of the peanuts here. They came out sinfully good and I&#039;m so glad that I made only 12 because I&#039;ve already eaten 5 and packed the rest in the freezer where, for some reason that even I don&#039;t understand, I won&#039;t touch any more until I&#039;m ready to enjoy one with coffee or tea.

While I was making the batter, I decided that 3/4 cup of butter (that's 1 1/2 sticks!) really was an awful lot, so I used 3/4 stick (3/8 cup) of butter instead. The batter was a bit sticky with that reduction, so I spooned it on top. There was actually plenty of batter to go around, and I think a full batch of this batter would've been too much in a 9 round pan.<br/><br/>This recipe, as written, is like an apple cake. The recipe as I made it has about half the fat, four times the apples, and still has more batter than I'd really like on my baked apples (personal preference, as I really love apples). It was a change of pace, it tasted fine, but I'll make a normal apple pie after this."},{"name":"panera s cream cheese potato soup","steps":"combine broth , potatoes , and spices', 'boil on medium heat until potatoes are tender', 'smash a few of the potatoes to release their starch for thickening', 'reduce to low heat', 'add cream cheese', 'heat , stirring frequently , until cheese melts'","description":"this is my favorite recipe for potato soup.  it's a copycat of the one they use to serve at the st. louis bread company (panera).  the recipe originally called for shredding your potatoes, but i never could get them to cook that way. i know they should cook faster, but i never could get it to work.","ingredients":"chicken broth', 'potatoes', 'seasoning salt', 'white pepper', 'ground red pepper', 'cream cheese'","review":"Absolutely delicious, easy and inexpensive to make.

I&#039;d suggest maybe adding some apple cider or water to make up the difference because this should DEFINITELY be poured.) The topping makes its way throughout the apples and is fantastic as written.

I love tomato cream sauce so I picked this one to try. Only thing is, I didn't have any heavy cream and didn't have time to go shopping after work so I worked with what I had in the fridge. And what I had in the fridge to replace the heavy cream was a 300 gram tub of creamy ricotta cheese. I used the whole tub. I also had bacon so I cut up 4 slices of cooked bacon and threw that in. Also, I thought I was opening up a can of crushed tomatoes and I accidentally grabbed a tin of whole tomatoes so ended up using the whole tomatoes and a tin of diced tomatoes. Because they have so much liquid in them, I added a tin of tomato paste and reduced the liquid a bit before continuing with the recipe. I did add more chilli peppers though because we love spice. I added about 3/4 cup of parm/reg cheese mix. I cooked brown rice penne and undercooked it because the sauce was more runny than usual so it soaked up the liquid after mixing it all together. Turned out perfect. I could eat this every week. One thing I don't think I'll add next time I make it is the vodka. I honestly didn't notice the taste so to me it was a waste of a good drink lol.

I must say I had quite a bit of trouble filling the bagels with the berry mixture.  I think it was my fault though.  I used 4 tsp raspberry jam instead of 2 tsp extract and dried cranberries with some finely chopped frozen blueberries.  I think this made the filling too mushy so it tried to escape out when I tried to pinch it into the bagel.  Next time I shall try it with the extract and all dried berries.  If it doesn't work I guess I could just mix it in with the batter, although the berry filling in the bagels was a nice treat!  Otherwise I did exactly as stated except used about 60% whole wheat flour.  The texture of these bagels is devine!!  Somewhat fluffy yet moist and chewy like real bagels.  As stated these were LARGE bagels.  Next time I think I will form them into 15 or so instead of 12 so they are a bit smaller.  I sprinkled some of the extra filling on top of the bagles after I brushed with the eggwash which made them look very nice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used about 1/2 over the cake, and I dont recommend it, because I have been disappointed in the past with tres leches cakes,I was trying to avoid a soggy cake.
