For the marinade, I draped an open gallon-size Ziploc over the sides of a bowl, and mixed the marinade right in the bag. I reserved the juice from a 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks that I already had (which came out to about 2/3 of a cup), used 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1 heaping teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar, 2 Tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, a few shakes of salt, and 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. After I put the red pepper flakes in, it looked like a TON. I got all freaked out that we were going to be breathing fire (you know, like that Wendy's commercial), so I took a tiny (it was REALLY small) bit out with my fingers - which probably didn't really make a difference.

This is not just any coffee cake.  It is a very old tradition of early American Christians who settled in parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina (primarily Winston-Salem, NC and Bethlehem, PA).  The icing is not traditional based on what I know.  I've never seen icing on a sugar cake in Winston-Salem, NC (and I've been eating sugar cake for over 30 yrs).  I didn't and wouldn't bother with the icing.  There's plenty of sweetness without it !!!! This cake is very, very sweet.  If you want it slightly less sweet, add a little extra cinnamon (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) and reduce the brown sugar you sprinkle on top.  It will still be awesome!  Don't be perfectionistic about putting the dough in the pan...it is supposed to be the consistency the author says it should be.  Try to get it to stick to the sides of the pan a bit as you spread it out and it will stay put better.  It doesn't have to be perfectly even b/c you are going to punch holes in it and douse it w/ brown sugar & butter anyway...so not to worry.

The original reason for the invention of scrapper was to use up the scrap meat left over when butchering a hog. Most of this meat was in the head. There was a lot of gristle and non meat ingredients included in the mix. After simmering all day in a pot, the gristle and fat was rendered to a softened state. The head itself was also in the pot. This cooking process released a lot of gelatinous into the broth, which when cooled, gel and hold the loaf together. There is no gelatin in pork loin. The answer is to use a bony cut of pork and allow it to simmer for a long time or use a crock pot. Ideally, pork jocks, a ham bone, or pigs feet would do the job. I suppose that gelatin pack(s) would work.  I use a couple of smoked jocks and ground pork. After cooking, I process them together, including skin,  which is very soft.

I discovered it in time for my children's school Halloween party and have made the cookies four times over the past month.  The teachers confiscated the cookies at the Halloween party and kept them at the adult table; they said the cookies were too good to share with the kids.  My favorite batch includes 16 snack-size Mounds bars, 2 full-size Snickers with almonds, and dark chocolate covered raisins.  That batch was pretty and delicious.  It was even better the second day; the cookies stayed chewy and wonderful.  I added the salt in when I creamed the butter and sugar; I guess that was right.  I also made a batch without oatmeal and used all white sugar, butter flavor Crisco instead of butter, and chopped almonds instead of peanuts or pecans that time...fabulous!  No matter what way I make these, people rave about them and beg for the recipe.  Even the men at my office, not normally big fans of dessert, ask for these cookies.

Update: I'm updating my review for changes I've made to this recipe. This time when I made these cookies this time I used Splenda Sugar Blend for the sugar, Splend brown sugar, unsweetened coconut, golden raisins, I added baby ruth, butter finger, whoopers (left out the krackal, mr. goodbar, and hershey bars) and I added 1 scoop of protein powder to bump my protein. No difference these still turned out great. My only problem my now 7 yr old newphew and I were making these together and it took us longer to roll the dough so it had a chance to dry out which cause them not to roll so easy. I decided to try a bit of water which was a big mistake this made the cookies bake way to flat, so I ended up adding more flour which made them just right. The rest I left the same as my previous review. My previous review Jan 30th 2008. My newphews 3 & 5 and I loved these cookies. I was a bit worried about the amount of baking soda but all turned out fine. These are just as described crisp and chewy. I found this recipe just after this last halloween after we ran out of candy bars. So I recently purchased some candy bars to try these. I bought mini Twix, Snickers, Milky Way, Krackal, Mr. Goodbar, 3 Musketeers, Hershey Bars, and I had M&M's already on hand. These were very yummy. I made a few minor changes to the recipe. I only used 2 cups oatmeal as I thought that was plenty, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts nuts as we are not nuts over nuts, and no raisins as we were out of them. The rest I did as directed. I'm glad I made the few minor changes as I found this was a little hard to mix even in my extra-large mixing bowl. I also found the dough a bit dry after mixing everything in. I would recommend making the balls up first before baking as when I was baking my cookies I was using 1 cookie sheet (didn't want to wash more) and it took forever and my dough began to dry out and the last batch I tried adding a bit of water to soften and they crumbled and would not roll. Overall these were very good and I will make these cookies again for sure. Thanks for posting a really good recipe.
