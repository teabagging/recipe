The first failure was my fault, because I used all-purpose flour which, in fact, is not all-purpose after all. So, after 10 hours of sponging & waiting, fermenting & waiting, proofing and waiting, baking and waiting, I had 2 flat loaves of hard bread-  that was attempt #1.  Today, I was sure that it would come out right as I bought bread flour just for this recipe.  The sponging was successful, as was the fermenting (after I added a little heat to the equation).  Upon cutting the dough in half, it dropped/flattened but I divided it into 2 pans anyway.  I was hoping that all of this effort including kneading the dough by hand again was not in vain.  Once the dough was divided, it took a few hours just to get it to rise again (not double) and that included adding a little heat, because it wouldn't move otherwise.  The results of the 2nd batch was disappointing but not as bad as the first.  I baked the loaves only 30 minutes and they still seemed dry and overdone.  The taste is familiar but not quite there (I lived in Taunton,Mass. for 30 years). The texture was rough and flat not light and fluffy.  I don't have any fancy equipment to make bread.  It was all elbow grease.  So, I'll leave this recipe to the experts as I don't have the enthusiasm to attempt this a 3rd time.

I wouldn't call them thick, but they were certainly big in diameter and slightly thicker than the recipe I normally use.\\n\\nThe last ones into the oven went on the stoneware pan again, which I scraped clean and then greased.

My daughter said, this tastes like a restaurant meal. I'd say that was high praise indeed! The recipe comes together easily. I love the cooking of broccoli in the same pot as the pasta.

When I have more time, I will try Chef DiB's recipe. :)  A few adjustments I made were: I used about 3/4 lb. of fettucine and more than one cup of alfredo sauce ( one jar) and it seemed like the perfect ratio for us.  Also, I used the same pan that the mushrooms, gr. onion and garlic was cooked in to heat up the alfredo sauce. I wanted to make sure it was all hot. I added the cooked shrimp to the alfredo sauce to get them heated up , too. Only for about a min., I didn't want to overcook them. Then I tossed it all together.\\nGREAT, restaurant-quality recipe.

We won't have any trouble eating the bread as is, however, and there's always a next time. I made this bread by hand, but was very careful to use the ingredients called for, and measure them exactly. I used the exact amount of bread flour (not bread machine,) flour and whole wheat flour. For the whole wheat, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour with somewhat larger bits (called graham flour), and 3/4 cup finely milled whole wheat bread flour. I got one 615 gram loaf, six rolls of 60 grams each, and one 50-gram roll. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

I made exactly as posted with excellent results. As I only use Penzy's spices I normaly use half the amount in a recipe as their spices are some stronger than those purchased at the grocery. In this I used exact amounts which was perfect. I suggest using the roasted pine nuts as they add such as wonderful flavor. I purchase pine nuts at an Italian Market where they are less expensive and I can chose smaller amounts. \\n Having several more chicken breasts I made a second batch after supper tonight. To this batch I added 1/4 teaspoon Garam Masala which gave a slighty more intense India flavor however, the recipe is perfect as is. \\n Thanks for another great recipe Uncle Bill.

Bear in mind this is a soup, the photo shows it served over rice. You can always add more broth to ensure it's not quite so thick.
