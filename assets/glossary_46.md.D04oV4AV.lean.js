Also, these don't quite have the browned butter taste of stove top caramels, but they are sooo good for something so simple. I microwaved them for 2 mins to start with, stirred, and then in 1 minute increments after that to ensure that there were no sugar crystals left in the mix after that. I microwaved for 7 minutes and 30 seconds. The caramels turned out soft and chewy but not great at holding shape. I would probably try microwaving them for 8 minutes and maybe 8.5 or 9 after testing. I also tried the cold water test to see how they were and they were about soft ball stage when I stopped testing and pulled them as it seems like when I make caramels I tend to not account for the few minutes at the end where the temp is still rising because the mixture has so much heat in it.

If you haven't, TRY IT ANYWAY! Just be prepared to make a few batches to perfect your technique. <br/><br/>This taste a little more milky than store bought kraft caramels. I like this best with nuts (I've tried walnut and almond so far) and sometimes dipping them in milk chocolate.<br/><br/>I used salted butter and add a pinch of salt to ingredients and also add about 1/4 tsp vanilla extract after pulling from microwave for the last time.<br/>I totally recommend using a silpat(or similar) liner. SOOO much easier than the (bad) foil experience I had.<br/>I used the cold water method to help determine when my caramels were ready. The first time I had to keep adding 1 minute until it was setting firm enough. If your caramels are too soft for you, please try again, but add more time. Don't give up, these are tasty and give a great sense of accomplishment :).<br/><br/><br/>I recommend parchment paper to wrap, as I found that the wax paper will not peel well if caramel got a little warm (like in my niece's pocket). Parchment paper did not have that problem. <br/>Thank you Debbwl for the recipe, everyone has really enjoyed these!

I think in the recipe though, it should be added that times may vary, and give a description of how it should look when done.

I have a suggestion to make individual caramels that are super easy to handle. I used a silicone mini-muffin pan and filled each one about 1/2 to 3/4 full. After sitting in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes they popped right out and I dipped each one in melted dark chocolate. It makes a perfect 2 bite candy. They look like professional chocolates you buy in a store. I will upload a picture as soon as I can..... Updating 3 years later to address some issues I&#039;ve seen in reviews... I&#039;ve made this recipe more times than I can count and here is what I&#039;ve learned. 1, Use a tall bowl, the caramel bubbles up. I use a 6 cup Pyrex batter bowl. 2. Melt the butter before adding the other ingredients, it makes them easier to fully incorporate. 3. Always fully stir and thoroughly scrape down the bowl to remove any sugar crystals after every 2 minutes. 4. Yes, microwaves differ, when you are done you should have a noticeably thicker (like a cream soup) mixture and it will be a deeper gold/brown than it started. Add one minute at a time. 5. I use the small plastic wrapper bags you can get at popular craft stores. They are easy to wrap and eat with. 6. Silicone pans and molds are the way to go for easy removal from the mold, just make sure they&#039;re heatproof.

I doubled the recipe and used Aussie cup measurements, 70gram eggs (large) and olive oil. The pasta was very soft -so I incorporated more tapioca flour as I kneaded it. Spread some tapioca flour on my bench to roll out the pasta and on my fork to press together the ravioli. Wrapped in cling-wrap to rest for 30 minutes before rolling out. I did try the pasta press but my dough was very soft and pliable. I used a rolling pin with great success. I didn't find the dough hard to work with at all. Perhaps my eggs were larger or I added a larger amount of oil . 1 Aussie tablespoon equals 4 teaspoons. I made my pasta into ravioli and used your Recipe#263927 as filling. Topped with a gluten-free bottled sauce and fine slices of parmesan cheese. This is the best gluten-free pasta I have tasted.

I made the chicken and the leftover in a chicken salad this weekend (with my own mashed potato recipe) - both turned out perfectly! Nothing beats the veggies that roast and caramelize under the chicken.The chicken is perfectly flavored and moist. Your Creatively reimagined, roast chicken can lead to great things. Try it in casseroles, chicken salads. The chicken turned out wonderfully. I do have a few pointers for any novices out there are old and forget thing like me - I definitely make a Maple herb butter the night before to make the next day that much easier, &quot;marjoram&quot; is a plant and I went to the grocery store and found it in the spices and used that (it worked great). Also, when you first place the chicken in the oven on 375 for 30 minutes, make sure to keep an eye on it. The baste cooked very quickly on top of the skin and burnt, I just wasn&#039;t paying attention. It didn&#039;t matter at all since you cut the skin off before you serve it anyway, but if you are concerned about presentation then keep an eye on it. I do HIGHLY recommend using the gravy recipe included, the flavor was incredible and tastes great on the leftover sandwiches as a spread!!

I have never made Shepherds pie, it just never appealed to me, so I can not compare this recipe to it, nor would I try. I did not have shredded cheddar (it disappears pretty quick around my house) so I used thin Velvetta slices instead and they created a very creamy layer.  I also thought it would take a lot of time in the prep, however, you are boiling the potatoes while browning the meat and onions, and heating the green beans while mashing the potatoes.

I also never used puff pastry before which may have added to the problem. Problem 2: I wasn't sure of the equivalent to sweet biscut crumbs so I used biscotti crumbs (I have a feeling they may not be equivalent).  Problem 3: sugar equivalents -- there didn't seem to be enough sugar to sweeten the fruit.  \\nSo how I made this desert  was putting the pastry in the 8-inch pan, covered it with the crumbs and put the fruit over it, sprinkled with one tablespoon sugar, baked for 30 minutes at 400- degrees. Since I knew I didn't make the desert as directed I skipped the jelly part at the end. Desert was okay but basically it was barely sweetened fruit over a crust.

The second one I mixed and turned into jerky right away. I use a jerky gun and found the first batch worked a little better consistency wise.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who are wondering about timing as I was: I used my Nesco dehydrator - simple one nothing fancy - at 165 degrees and the first batch I started at about 1 pm and finished around 10 pm, only because I didn&#039;t want to leave it going all night without supervision. Second batch I started at about 9 pm and ran until around 8 -9 am the next day. Both turned out great - the second one was a little drier but not tough. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh and four pounds of meat was more than I could fit in my four-level dehydrator at one time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally as I was putting away my jerky gun from the second batch I noticed a big warning in the instructions about using sodium nitrate as a cure to avoid botulism. It kind of freaked me out so I did some research and got conflicting opinions. (I will note I made this twice w/out a cure and didn&#039;t get sick). I try to eat healthy, which is one reason I am making jerky myself to get away from the junk in most of it. I even use grassfed beef to make it, but in this case I decided to order some pink salt for my next batches just to be safe.

The oeigional recipe did not include either/or for the sweetener. It said sugar, 3. The original recipe said mayonnaise, not or low fat. There was not a low-option when this recipe was created.

I just saw the pics in my camera. This was an excellent stuffed pepper recipe. I loved the addition of the orzo. It added a great flavor and texture. I had used pork for my meat. I also used one red and one yellow pepper, just for some nice color.  I couldn't find kasseri cheese at all here, (no surprise) so I used freshly grated parmesan . That really worked out well. I also added some garlic because I love it so much. It is great that this was so quick to put together. I got it all ready for the oven so my daughter was able to just pop it in for me. Just took an extra 5 or 10 minutes to heat so 25 instead of 15. I probably had enough mixture left for another pepper so I did as suggested and just put in the dish. But I will say everyone just loved it. Served it with some garlic mashed potatoes. But took the picture before I added the salad to the plate..old age..I am forgetting..I will keep this to make again that is for sure. My DD's BF was over for dinner and he loved it as well. He never tried it before and truly enjoyed this.
