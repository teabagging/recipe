However, I had to make some modifications to this recipe.  Mainly because I don't think I did the initial prep of the cabbage the way I should have.  Instead of just letting the salted cabbage sit out in my cool kitchen, I put it in the frig.  This kept the cabbage from 'working' as my sauerkraut making family would say.  Anyhow, after three days in the frig I made the brine and placed in jars and again put it in the frig.   After several days I tasted it and the cabbage still seemed to be too raw.  Then I dumped it all in a pot and simmered it on the stove for about 45-60 minutes and added more sugar after tasting it.   This resulted in a more tender cabbage but still firm.  My family really enjoyed it.   This isn't a dish you want a huge helping of. But with all the sweets and goodies on the Christmas dinner table, a sour dish is always a welcome change.  I served it cold as my mother-in-law said she had it in a PA Dutch restaurant.  But next day I heated mine and not sure which way I liked it better.   If you are looking for a more traditional dish to serve with ham, try this one.  Thank you for posting.  Hope more people try this recipe.

His sister and two brothers heartily agreed, and you can't get a better review than that in my book! :-) A couple of notes: I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon (by mistake); seemed to work well, though. As a first-timer in broiling burgers, I made the mistake of using a baking sheet with open corners--made quite a mess in the oven from the drippings. My bad!! The burgers kind of puffed up during cooking, so I'll make the patties thinner and larger in diameter next time.

I beat it to the point where it would stand up, which I mistook to mean stiff peaks. Pulled it off the heat and beat it some more, then added the coconut, only to find that I had frosting that was starting to crystalize. Oops. So I baked another cake (one was for a party), then doubled the frosting batch using a smaller glass (Pyrex) bowl over a different pan. It took a little longer to beat initially (perhaps six minutes), then I removed it from the heat and beat it *just* til there were soft peaks that stood still and didn't slide when I lifted the beaters away. Just right! :) I added unsweetened coconut and sprinkled some more on top. Very good.

YUMMY!  I let my steaks marinade for about 3 hours, turning them every once in a while.  It was nice to cook a recipe designed for two people.  Spraying the grill with non-stick spray really worked - I was worried that with the honey it was going to stick and burn on the grill, but it didn't (I used high heat Canola oil non-stick spray).  I liked the hint of sweetness the honey brought - plus, I love the beautiful glaze the marinade gave to the steak (my picture really doesn't do it justice).

I am super happy to have an alternative to Spanish Rice, and this recpe is really easy to make and does not take nearly as long to cook as rice.  Served with Recipe #89519, Mexican Fish. We took a tip from another rater and used olive oil instead of butter, and that worked great.  Might try some salsa or chopped tomatoes in it next time as well.

It is so flavorful and melt in your mouth, and is great to be able to duplicate at home!  There are several copycat recipes for this with slightly different variations but I decided to use this recipe since it seemed to have two servings and the sauce ratios seemed right.  It sure lives up to being a close copycat!  It is just a little more lemony than the restaurants, but that can easily be fixed with adding a little less lemon juice.  I actually think I liked it a little more lemony anyways!  Also the restaurant doesn't add as much sundried tomatoes which is also easy to cut down.  I just sauteed my chicken breasts in a skillet and when they were almost done I added a little bit of the sauce to get infused into the meat.  The key to get the sauce so flavorful is to really reduce it well.  It may not look like much sauce when your done, but that light coating of sauce will really make your dish pop!  Such an excellent recipe!  Its so great that we can have chicken bryan at home now!
