If you want it to be exactly the same, I would guess another ten minutes of cooking after you add the vegetables would do it. I didn't mind crunchy vegetables, so it was great as-is.

My seasoning adjustments make it taste more like Panera's. My cooking recommendations are what works best for me for a busy weeknight meal. In a pot, add chicken broth. My favorite chicken stock is Better Bouillon paste (keep refrigerated). I add an extra half a cup of liquid bc I will be boiling veggies with lid on. Add the broccoli and carrots. I use frozen chopped broccoli florets with half of the stems removed and a bag of pre-julienned carrots (found in produce section near baby carrots). Boil covered over medium heat for 10 minutes. (This cooking time varies greatly by what kind/size pan you are using and your heat level. Take the lid of often to check. Only boil until carrots are tender.) I use my immersion blender to puree veggie/broth mixture bc my young children will only it eat it pureed. Otherwise, Panera broccoli cheese is NOT pureed. In a separate pan, make white sauce. Over medium heat, Saut&eacute; onion in butter. When onions translucent add garlic. Saut&eacute;. Turn heat to low. Add flour. Whisk. Slowly add heavy cream (not half and half). Turn heat off. Add cheese. It actually taste more like Panera if you use three cheese powder, but using 1/2 shredded Cabot cheddar cheese and 1/2 American cheese like Velveeta is desirable. This will be very thick. You want it to be! Turn heat back on low white sauce. Slowly add chicken broth broccoli and carrots mixture while whisking into white sauce. Stir in seasoning to your liking 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. white wine, 1 tsp. dijon mustard, and 1/2 tsp. hot sauce. (My young children prefer no white wine, 1 tsp dry mustard powder, and 1/4 tsp. hot sauce.) Another note: I have thickened soup with potato starch for gluten free. you can use lactose free real sharp cheddar cheese and soy heavy cream for lactose free options. I normally make Rhodes frozen dinner rolls to accompany this soup. I use the quick method. I defrost frozen rolls in microwave, so they will raise in 1 hour on my hot stove near where I'm cooking.

Only changes I made were 2 cloves of garlic sauted with the onion, whole milk instead of half/half, and I only added about five ounces of cheese as opposed to eight. Seemed like 8 ounces was a bit much for such a small volume of soup. The soup thickened up beautifully. Creamy and thick without being overly rich. For those who complain that this has no flavor, I am baffled. My first guess is lack of salt. The soup does require a good bit of salt and pepper, but that's the nature of any recipe. You salt as you go, and add as much as you think it needs to bring out the flavor. My second guess is using a bland supermarket cheese. I used a good quality cheddar from Trader Joe's. Not expensive at all, but way more flavor than the bland rubbery stuff.

I always have a difficult time finding layer cakes that my husband will like; he finds most too sweet, especially the frosting.  I made this for his birthday and we both loved it.  It is very fudgy and dense, but not too sweet.  The only caveat is that I found the icing difficult to spread neatly.  When I made it, it was fairly liquid and thin.  It ran down off the cake layers like a glaze and puddled up on the plate.  Luckily I had made a bit extra and had put paper plates under the cake to catch the excess.  I also should add that I seem to be quite mechanically challenged when it comes to icing cakes, so a more experienced baker probably would have had less difficulty.  Anyway, as the cake and icing sat/chilled, the icing firmed up to a fabulous chewy fudge without that real sweet taste found in a lot of frostings. It also hardened into an almost candy like glaze that was very pretty.  So definitely this recipe goes into the make again-- and again-- and again file!

I used a half-sheet pan, and the batter did not cover it entirely. My cake looked more like a slightly misshapen cookie than a sheet cake, but it was thick enough (about one inch)and was light and fluffy. Once I covered it with the cream cheese layer and the strawberries, the shape wasn't a problem. I used a white cake mix and added a teaspoon of almond flavoring; I'll probably add more next time. I added lots of blueberries on top of the strawberry/glaze layer, as the dessert was to be served as a Fourth of July treat. The presentation was very nice. I used two pounds of strawberries and had just enough to cover the top of the cake. I used about one and a half tubs (14 oz.?) of Marie's glaze, and I used Extra Creamy Cool Whip (the small tub)instead of homemade whipped cream. People had multiple servings, took home leftovers, and asked for the recipe.

I used Hormel No bean Chili.  I didn't like it out of the can, so obviously I wasn't thrilled about it in the meatloaf.  However, I think that if I used my Chile Con Carne recipe or another one that I liked I would have enjoyed the meatloaf a lot more.  That's why I rounded up to 4 stars instead of down to 3 - because I honestly think that this has potential.  The chili provides most of the flavoring, so that is the most important ingredient.  I did add ketchup to it, and that really helped with the taste.  My DH went back for seconds.  \\nAlso, I just couldn't bring myself to put the meatloaf in a round pan.

The cinnamon and nutmeg make it complete. No ingredient  dominate the others, they complete each other.\\n\\nIn the beginning I was a little bit sceptical, because in most cases I do not like syrup soaked cakes.
