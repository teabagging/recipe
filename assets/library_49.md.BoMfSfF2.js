Like Anu's, my potatoes were done in 15 minutes. I used all the salt called for, but decided to use Kosher instead of iodized after reading the comments. It wasn't too salty at all.

Instead of cooking uncovered the last 15 minutes, I popped it under the broiler until the cheese was melted and bubbly. Next time, I'm going to try it without altering the ingredients. I'll bet it will be just as wonderful without all the added fat. And, yes, watch out for that milk boiling over! Mine didn't (thanks to the comments), but I had to turn my burner past the low setting to the extra low.

I only used 1 lb. of the ground beef, I added 2 (8 oz.) cans of the tomato sauce, plus I substituted 2 cups of Dumpling Egg Noodles, (Creamettes' brand) for the 1-1/2 cups of broken lasagna noodles, as I couldn't find any mafalda noodles, (mini lasagna noodles) that I really wanted to use in this recipe.  I added the dumpling noodles after I brought the soup to a boil.  They were done cooking within 12 minutes.  After I stirred in the Parmesan cheese, (within 3 more minutes) the soup was competely done.  My husband and I prefered this soup with out the croutons and the Mozzarella cheese.  By adding them, you no longer could taste the spices/seasonings in the soup.  Instead of topping the soup with the croutons and Mozzarella cheese, we just topped our's with a bit more of the Parmesan cheese.  The Parmesan cheese makes this soup taste wonderful.  Since I didn't add exactly 1-1/2 lbs. of the ground beef, and didn't use regular lasagna noodles, nor the croutons and Mozzarella cheese, I found this recipe to be more of a soup than a stoup, (not so thick) plus by adding smaller noodles, the soup got done a lot quicker (within a total of 15 minutes).

Because I used the Basil Sauce I nixed the sugar as the sauce is pretty sweet as is. Many reviewers said that lasagna noodles took almost an hour to cook, and I didn't want to wait that long so I used mixed vegetable spiral pasta. These cooked up in about 30 minutes and worked great.

The batter was thin as stated but the cakes turned out well. They crisped up on top (which I enjoy) and were very moist. They do have a nice espresso flavor, so if you aren't a coffee/dark chocolate fan I wouldn't recommend this recipe to you.

To me, the color, really didn&#039;t make a difference as to how the potato tasted, and very similar to a red skinned potato for taste and texture.  Totally loved the combination of the roux, cheeses and bacon, so good.  I checked mine at the recommended time of 40 mins, and my taters were still not soft, so I added another 1/2 hour, which worked out great.   I have found that even with sliced taters, they still are piled upon each other, and seem to take the same amount of time to cook as a baked tater.  But WOW, do these have a ton of flavor!!   I doubt I will bother buying the purple potatoes again (I guess they aren&#039;t popular enough here and aren&#039;t as fresh as red skinned or baking taters) but will definitely make this recipe again with other potatoes!!

I adjusted the recipe slightly, based on what I had on-hand and personal preferences.  I used wheat bran instead of oat bran, sucanat instead of the Splenda/brown sugar, 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute, grade B maple syrup instead of the corn syrup/maple extract, safflower oil instead of walnut and omitted the walnuts altogether... that sounds like a lot, but I don't think it affected the overall outcome of the recipe overall much!  I found that the easiest way to form the cookies is to wet your hands and make small patties like you would for making hamburgers.  Don't worry about them being too flat- the baking soda in the recipe will still make them rise.  I also recommend letting the dough sit for a bit before you start forming the cookies - mine was a little crumbly to begin with but once I let it sit and let the oats and bran absorb the wet ingredients somewhat, it was much more cohesive and easy to work with.  These are certainly chocolatey, but not extremely so, which is nice, though, because it really lets you taste the maple flavor.  The texture of these reminds me somewhat of macaroons with the chewy oats.  One great thing about these is, unlike most other cookies, they are really filling, which makes it a lot easier to not keep going back to the cookie jar for one more.

This was my first time ever cooking with a dry bean. I soaked my beans over night as I was told was best by several people. I used Splenda brown sugar blend for the brown sugar. I used hot sauce for the Tabasco sauce. I only used 1/2 tsp chili powder not to over power the taste. I only used 1/8 tsp dry cilantro. I cooked my beans on for 8 hours. These beans need constant stirring halfway through cooking as they really begin to stick. Overall I'd make them again. Thanks for posting!

I'm not assigning stars, because it's possibly just my personal taste, but I found the cookies to be very gummy after baking. The dough smelled wonderful while I was making it, so I had high hopes for the finished cookies -- the kirsch is very strong while the dough is being made, but it mellows out once the cookies are baked. I thought that there was a lot of flour in this, and the dough was really stiff, but I also thought that the 1 hour of resting time might help out with that. When the hour was up, I wasn't able to roll it out, so I just kind of made a giant snake out of it and sliced the cookies instead. The dough just wasn't very pliable. I placed the slices in the pan, brushed them with milk and baked them for 15 minutes. They still looked exactly as they did when they went in, so I put them back in the oven for another 5 minutes. Some of the cookies started to brown a bit at that point, so I took them out. The flavor was very pleasant, but I just couldn't get past the texture. They kind of reminded me of those old-school fat-free snack cakes (like when Snackwell's first came out). I think the dough just needs some tweaking (more egg? more honey? some butter?), because the taste is already there, but the gumminess was definitely a problem for me.

This was one of the best salads I've had in a long, long time. With the blend of colors it looks as good as it tastes, too. I couldn't find watercress so omitted it; in retrospect, I think fresh spinach would be a good sub for that and will definitely try that next time. The only other change in my salad was to substitute crumbled feta for the blue cheese, as I was not among blue cheese afficianados, lol. It worked very well and had a mellower flavor than the blue cheese would have, allowing the other toppings (especially the cranberries and pecans) to really shine. I wasn't exactly sure what result I was looking for when baking the pecans but after 45 minutes they were crisp and light and the coating had turned to something like a light toffee (and smelled divine) so I stopped there. They were SO good that the kids and I were having a hard time not eating them all while they were cooling. (Hint: do not let the pan/spoon cool down too much before you wash/soak them because that syrup hardens into stone, lol.) A full cup of pecans seemed like a bit much once we got to putting them on the lettuce so I used closer to 1/2-3/4 c and have saved the rest back for other salads.
