Finally, I did not include the water as the meatball mixture was extremely moist already.  As for the sauce, the flavor wasn&#039;t what I expected.  Mine didn&#039;t thicken nor did it have much flavor - so I added dill and thyme and used cornstarch to thicken.

So after trying to settle down a bit, here goes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a.  The recipe is very poorly written.  I have provided many recipes over the years to family, friends and as contributions to charity/fundraiser cookbooks.  I write recipes in painstaking detail...nothing unnecessary...so that the cook who is using my recipe doesn&#039;t have to guess about what they need to do.  EVERYTHING must be spelled out precisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b.  When I am following a recipe I prepare all the ingredients as listed and described completely so when it&#039;s time to use them I&#039;m not scurrying around for something.&lt;br/&gt;\\ti.  Direction number two is &quot;Fry the onion till golden in a couple of tablespoons of lightly browned butter.  The recipe calls for 2 TBSP of butter.  Direction number 7 is &quot;Fry them slowly in plenty of butter.&quot;  What is PLENTY of butter.  This needs to be more specific.  When cooks have prepared something many times they progress beyond needing specific amounts often, because they have personalized the recipe and it&#039;s their own.  But this and every published recipe must be done as though the chef is making the recipe for the first time.  Because this was my first  time, as I said, I followed the directions exactly.&lt;br/&gt;\\tii.  Based on the list of ingredients I made sure I had soy sauce on hand.  Admittedly the recipe called for 1/4 teaspoon of soy sauce.  REALLY?  In a pound of meat 1/4 teaspoon of soy sauce. BUT WAIT:  after making sure you have the soy sauce, it is never mentioned again.  Where are we to put the soy sauce?  In the meat?  In the cream sauce?&lt;br/&gt;\\tiii.  The ingredients call for &quot;1/2 cup cream {half and half} or 1/2 cup milk.  I&#039;m sorry but this is unintelligible.  Should we use cream or half and half or milk.  Why is &quot;half and half&quot; in brackets?  Cream is cream.  Half and half is half and half and milk is milk.  DECIDE and then tell us what to do.  If we want to change it to accommodate a particular lifestyle we will change it, but please be clear about what the cook is supposed to use...i.e., tell us what the standard of &quot;excellence&quot; is for this recipe.  What, in your mind, makes it best&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c.  After assembling the called for ingredients (and absolutely omitting the water because by the time all the other ingredients were assembled it was raw soup, not able to be formed into meatballs) I could not begin to move forward with shaping them into balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d.  I suggest the following which I did in an effort to save the $25 i spent on meat and ingredients I didn&#039;t have on hand:  (again, if you want to make changes to make it your own, OK, but I can only tell you what worked for me.&lt;br/&gt;\\ti.  Use cream, not  half and half and not milk.  Use 1/3 cup.&lt;br/&gt;\\tii. Completely omit the water.&lt;br/&gt;\\tiii.Based on this recipe, use at least 1/2c dried breadcrumbs and more if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;        iv. Add some flavor to the meat.  There is nothing but allspice and that, according to the &lt;br/&gt;&quot;source&quot; is optional.  I don&#039;t know about you, but I think meatballs are basically mini/round meatloaves.  I do not make a meatloaf devoid of seasoning.  Why would I make a meatball devoid of seasoning.  YES, I know that people rave about the sauce, but I have learned this in my years of cooking:  if the meat itself is not seasoned and only depends on the sauce it&#039;s in for flavor, what you get is a mouthful of unflavored meat with some sauce on it.  I learned this the hard way with &quot;The Best Chili You Will Ever Taste&quot; when I thought the chili was magnificent until i tasted the meat and it was like having a mouthful of flavorless..something.  Meat needs to be able to stand on its own and then be enhanced by a sauce...the sauce cannot make up for flavorless meat.  I don&#039;t know what Ikea meatballs are like...perhaps they are supposed to be bland and let the sauce do the work....personally, I added  two teaspoons of cumin, two teaspoons of ground coriander, two teaspoons of ground fennel and3 cloves of garlic to go along with the onion.&lt;br/&gt;\\tv.  Chill the meatball mixture for 2 hours.  More is OK, less is not a good idea.&lt;br/&gt;\\tvi.  Don&#039;t just cook the meatballs slowly in plenty of butter.  Use two tablespoons of butter, CLARIFIED if possible, and two tablespoons of olive oil.  Because you are cooking slowly, so as to make sure the meatball is cooked through without the outside being ruined, you can use olive oil despite it relatively low smoking point.  It will be OK...but cook on medium heat at best.  I&#039;m not being specific here because there are so many permutations of ranges...I use a Viking stovetop and have complete control...so anything wrong is my fault...to lower and raise temp immediately.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have now, based on the original recipe and only adding extra breadcrumbs and omitting the water...tried frying these little clumps.  They are flavorless by themselves and beg for the seasonings i mentioned above.  The texture is wonderful but the meatballs remain flavorless.&lt;br/&gt;Here&#039;s a great chance for you to season to your heart&#039;s content....or not...it&#039;s up to you how you want your meatballs to taste!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, I&#039;m sorry that this didn&#039;t turn out the way it should.  Thank you Dee_73 for giving us a great starting point to make some incredo meatballs.  I suggest making changes which will make these little morsels quite tasty.

Made exactly as directed, using a 1/2 teaspoon chili powder in the flour mixture (thank you for the GF option!) and because the garlic was left out of the instructions, I sauteed it with the onions and peppers.  I'm just a little on the fence with this recipe because right up until the end I was confident that we were going to love it.  While the rice was cooking my family was oohing and ahhing over just the smell and even though I was creating a lot of dirty dishes, I couldn't wait to see what a beautiful plate this was going to make.  I was visualizing red rice topped with green and white veggies, topped with the nicely browned chicken pieces.  (While cooking I forgot that more salsa was going to be added to the veggies.)  When I got to step 5 telling me to mix the veggies with the chicken, I should have plated like I was imagining it instead.  Stirring the chicken into the veggies just melted off most of the crunchy coating, losing that texture contrast, and on the plate it looked like a one-pot meal, but with a whole sink full of dishes to wash.  I'm so afraid this review is going to sound negative, but please don't take it that way.  It was good and has lots of potential with just a tweak in the method and leaving out the salsa in the veggies.  Everyone agreed that having 3 different colored and textured layers would have made this a 5 star presentation.  I felt like there was just too much time and mess involved to end up with a one-pot dish.  Thank you for submitting your creation, chef, and good luck in the contest!

(I wanted to use an open container)  Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  When the roast was done, I put the roast and juice in the fridge overnight and skimmed the fat the next day. (More healthy)  After I skimmed the fat from the juice, I used some of the juice & some chicken broth to steam cabbage for a side dish.  I heated the pork and thickened the remaining juice, with cornstarch, for a gravy. I added baked patatoes and had a wonderful supper.  The pork was juicy, tender, and, with the awsome tastey gravy, cabbage and patatoes. It was a to die for meal!  This is a keeper forever.

The dough was not what I expected, it was less like dough and more like moist crumbs.  Super easy to prepare though!  Pressing it in the cake pans was a lot like making a graham cracker pie crust.  I divided my plain dough in half and added 1/2 cup dried cranberries and the zest of 1 lemon to one half.  To the other I added 1/2 cup dried apricots and 1/4 tsp almond extract.  The results were fabulous!  I used glass pans and let the edges just start to brown before pulling from the oven, about 33 minutes for me.  I got 16 cookies per pan and they are soft with a nice chew and hold up very well.  I was worried when I first pulled them from the oven as they seemed very delicate but after cooling completely I do believe they will package up nicely for travel.  I can confirm the baked cookies freeze well and thaw without any trouble.

The mix of ingredients is great. So, we had the brioche bun, which we rubbed with butter and grilled quickly, then set aside. I had some leftover sliced of bacon that were already cooked. We had leftovers from a bag of oddly chopped foie gras we got cheap. From having made the foie gras for another meal, I had a leftover sauce (originally a half cup balsamic vinegar and half cup port cooked to a thick sauce). So, I took the sauce and warmed it back up and added 2 tbsp Dijon mustard and 2 tbsp beef/veal stock concentrate, and once thickened, I mixed in the 2 tbsp chives and 1 tbsp parsley and set it aside (keeping it warm. We took some grass-fed beef, sprinkled it generously with Worchestershire sauce, then a meat rub (my own recipe), and Maldon salt. We cooked the burgers on a stove top grill/griddle with butter, and while that cooked, we sauteed a sweet onion, adding 3 cloves of garlic and a large shallot (both minced) during the last two minutes of cooking, along with 2 tbsp parsley. We then put the slices of Gruyere on the burgers and covered them, so it melted. Topped the bottom of each bun with some pieces of warm and thick bacon, heaped on the onion mixture, then drizzled a good amount of the sauce over it, placed the burger with cheese on top, seared the foie gras to set over the cheese, and then heavily smeared the top of the bun with the remaining sauce.

And, I left out the ice cubes, but used frozen bananas for a very frosty drink! Also left out the honey, only because I felt that there was enough sweetness in the peach yogurt, OJ & the ripe bananas! VERY SATISFYING SMOOTHIE, for sure!
