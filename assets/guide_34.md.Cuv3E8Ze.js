I had alot of trouble with the glaze though, I followed the directions but the sugar did not seem to caramelize for me. I also thought 10 g of chocolate did not make the glaze thick enough. After two failed attempts to get the sugar to work I resorted to using the water, cocoa, and a big handful of chocolate chips (I ran out of the good chocolate)and that seemed to work better. After trying unsuccessfully to find hazelnuts and finding the strawberries at the store looking terrible, I settled on covering the top of the cake with chocolate curls that I curled off a milk chocolate bar with a vegetable peeler.

I worked at the spaghetti Factory in Indianapolis when I was around 25 (38 now) and I learned how to make this dish there.  I believe it is called Homer's something or other?  Anyway, this is so very simple, but you do have to be careful with the butter for 2 reasons.  1. Don't over or under cook the butter.  If you under cook it, you won't get the beautiful nuttiness flavor from the butter.  If you overcook it, it is just ruined.  It will just taste burnt, and def not worth wasting on myzithra.  2.  Make sure your pan is deep, not shallow for this reason:  placing a cold, or even room temp spoon into the hot butter WILL cause it to foam 10 times the amount of butter you originally had in the pan and WILL foam over the pan so this can be very dangerous (you can burn yourself, or IDK for sure but if you have gas, it may cause a fire - not positive about that, but better safe than sorry).

This was my first carrot cake ever, and I loved it.  It comes out very dense and rich, and very flavorful!  I made it for my baby's 1st birthday.  I did make some changes, however.  First, I left out the baking powder (I never use that stuff) and used 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda instead.  Also, I put the carrots (8 large = 4 cups) into the food processor instead of grating and they did well in the cake.  I ended up using 3.5 cups of carrots and 1.5 cups of pecans because I love pecans so much.  I added 1/2 cup soaked raisins.  I also used two circular pans instead of bundt, and cooked on 375 for 45 minutes.  After cooling, I cut both into two layers and lightly frosted a 4-layer carrot cake.  The frosting recipe had way too much sugar so I mixed softened cream cheese w/ honey and vanilla and beat w/ a hand beater.  Not sure of the measurements; I just added honey until the consistency was good for icing.

It recommended lining the pans (I bought 10 foil pans and it was worth it!) with parchment. It takes some extra minutes but the ease the layers come out of the pan, then a quick peel off of the paper, makes it STRESS-FREE. Since the layers are so thin I feel certain they'd have stuck to the foil pans without the paper. It is a real treat to eat a 10 layer cake and makes for great table conversation.

I made this tonight -- it couldn't be easier -- and there's nothing like a one pot meal!  I would reduce or leave out the olive oil the next time (or trim the fat on the shanks) -- the meat had enough fat to make the sauce silky.  I added 4 or 5 thickly sliced carrots to the vegetables in the bottom of the pot and 2 fresh bay leaves (because I had them).  I mixed up all the sauce ingredients and cut up all the veggies the night before.  In the morning, all I had to do was drop the veg, put the shanks on top and pour the sauce over --- and I was off to work.    I completely left it alone for 6 hours on HI (That's a rare thing for me, I'm usually poking and prodding the meat)  I fished out the bones when I got done work, and let the marrow fall down into the juices -- It was pretty much done then, but a few of the carrots and potatoes were still firm.  I kept it going on low for another hour or so.  The garlic smells very strongly early in the cooking, but it got nice and mellow by dinner time.

Easy to do, inexpensive, yet impressive.  I made it just as written.  I used the 1 Tbsp. red curry paste and found it added just the right amount of heat and intrigue!  (It was kind of a Goldilocks story here -- one person thought it was too hot, one added scriracha to make it hotter, and I thought it was juuuuust riiiight!)  So glad to find this recipe.  Thanks so much.\\n**Update:  Made again, still love it!  ;)"},{"name":"hamburger and yorkshire pudding","steps":"----------yorkshirepudding----------', 'sift flour and salt together', 'beat eggs and milk together', 'gradually add liquid to the flour', 'beat for two minutes and refrigerate', 'leave it in the fridge for at least an hour so it is ice cold when you pour it into baking dish', '-------meatballs-------------', 'mix all the ingredients together and shape into walnut sized balls', 'in a skillet brown the balls but so not cook through', 'putting it together: heat oven to 400f degrees', 'heat the cassorole dish & grease it', 'pour half of the yorkshire pudding into a 10x6x2 greased casserole dish', 'scatter the meat balls evenly in the batter', 'pour over the remaining batter', 'bake uncovered for about 25-30 minutes', 'the pudding should be puffed up around the meatballs and golden'","description":"this is similar to","ingredients":"eggs', 'milk', 'flour', 'salt', 'ground beef', 'pepper', 'dijon mustard', 'onion', 'cornstarch', 'ketchup', 'worcestershire sauce'","review":"This was a tasty and easy soup to make.

Big hit with the kids!  I'm sure they ate more then their fair share!  I have found this recipe in several different sites with the only difference being the amount of cinnamon used.

Only problem I found was cutting it into slices so we just pulled it apart and ate it!  Very Yummy!
