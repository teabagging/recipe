There we douse grilled chicken with the sauce, but a major treat is their heavenly hushpuppies, to which we also add the white sauce. I grill skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts pre-seasoned only with seasoned salt and serve the white sauce on the side when serving.

The recipe calls for LOW FAT yogurt, not non-fat.  Another review makes the point that the reason non-fat yogurt is gelatinous is because of GELATIN!  The recipe was formulated for low-fat yogurt.  I make lots of substitutions in recipes, but I would never PRESUME to rate a recipe for not turning out well when I did not follow the directions.<br/><br/>I thought this recipe turned out very well.  As another reviewer, I halved the recipe because I only had a 32 oz tub of yogurt and was a cup short for the full recipe.  I used low-fat Vanilla yogurt and Splenda instead of sugar.  I also agree with another reviewer that it can go straight in the ice cream maker after incorporating the yogurt and vanilla.<br/><br/>This is very light and refreshing.  My husband and I like intense vanilla flavor, and by using vanilla yogurt and vanilla extract it was quite tasty.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I think next time I may chunk up some fresh pineapple to drop in as well - I think the tartness of the pineapple would go well with the yogurt.

I like all the ingredients, and I had never been let down by a TOH recipe, but this recipe as written missed the mark. I shared with my co-workers, and quite a bit was left over. I rated 3 stars because it was too bland, so I would not make it again unless I switched pepper jack cheese for the Monterey jack cheese (wouldn't most families prefer cheddar?), or switched horseradish mustard for the Dijon mustard, or served a bunch of different accompaniments, such as catsup, jalapeno slices, or cheese sauce so people could adapt it to their tastes. On the plus side, this was just the right amount of mix to fill a 13 x 9 pan (see upper left corner of my closeup photo).  A coworker took her piece home and stuffed in Pepper Jack cheese and bacon bits before reheating, and her son declared it a winner.  DH loaded on shredded parmesan cheese and reheated, and enjoyed it very much.  I conclude that one must choose some strategy to add a little zip.

I would shrink the recipe down next time. I used the biggest bowl I had and it still wasn't big enough (I used 3 cups of each cereal). I also ended up having to add more almond bark (I used candy melt that I flavored with vanilla...and when I added the vanilla it seized the melts on the first batch). In total, I used 16 oz   12 oz of candy melts, for a total of 28 oz. More wouldn't hurt, since some of the cereal pieces didn't get coated. Still addictive!

Dear AskCy, this recipe is very hard for me to review. As my adopted cook, I'd love to give you 5 stars for every recipe!! This one made it to good (3 stars). It is perfectly nice, very easy, real comfort food, but the taste is very ordinary. Normally I would have added lots of herbs and maybe chillies, but I wanted us to taste your recipe as you wrote it. AskCy, maybe my biggest problem is with your cooking method, and I wonder if you'd consider editing your recipe? The litre of beef stock would have been FAR too much: I added 1 cup! (250 ml). (Did you make a mistake with that litre?) In the photos you can hopefully see 250 ml was enough, as the veggies also shed some liquid. I also have a problem with your cooking times. No ways could I cook this dish, after adding the peas, for a good hour!! I added the peas once the baby potatoes was almost tender, and it took literally minutes for the peas and potatoes to be perfect after that, and I removed it from the heat. A small point, but maybe worth mentioning for the 5-star recipes you are still going to post for us: list your ingredients in the order in which they will be used, i.e. oil first. The title: it puzzled me a little (this is not a criticism!) as we would never call a mince dish a stew. One associates a stew with chunks of meat. But never mind that. Also, this dish, with rice and sides, will feed at least 4 - 6 hungry people! Very economical in these times. Thank you, AskCy, and please post more of your recipes!"},{"name":"don t eat the  yellow snowman cookies","steps":"heat oven to 350f', 'in large bowl , combine cake mix , oil and eggs', 'beat until well mixed', 'place coconut in shallow bowl', 'for each cookie , use a cookie dough scoop to shape a 1-1 / 2-inch ball for the body , and a melon baller to shape a 1 / 2-inch ball for the head', 'roll each ball in coconut', 'place on ungreased cookie sheet with smaller ball touching larger ball', 'place cookies 1-1 / 2-inches apart', 'bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes or until coconut just begins to brown', immediately press eyes into head and buttons down the front of the snowman's body for each cookie, 'remove from cookie sheet to cool , taking care not to let the head separate from the body !'","description":"everyone knows you shouldn't eat yellow snow, but kids and grownups alike will get a kick out of making an exception in this case. this is an original recipe, developed with love to celebrate the snow on my son's january birthday! quick, easy and fun to make on a snowy day, lemon cake mix is a shortcut to tangy cookies that look as sweet as they taste. these snowmen will disappear even faster than the fellas outdoors!","ingredients":"lemon cake mix', 'vegetable oil', 'eggs', 'flaked coconut', 'decorative candies', 'miniature chocolate chip', 'candy sprinkles'","review":"These are outstanding!

Can't say I was entirely blown away but I recognize that part of that could have been because I couldn't follow all the directives to a &quot;t&quot;. Here are a few things I did differently: I didnt find this recipe until right before I was going to put the chickens in the oven so I didnt have the benefit of letting it soak in the rub ahead of time. I just made it up and put it directly in the oven. I doubled the recipe (I had two chickens) but kept all of the spice ratios the same except for the chili powder C which I cut in half (because were wimps). I used coconut sugar instead of regular for a smidge extra nutrition. I liberally seasoned the inside of the bird as well (and still had rub left over). We have a rotisserie but I didnt have time to fiddle with it so I just made them on a rack, in a roaster, in the oven at 400. I did have to move them around after a bit as the rub was getting too dark. Next time, Id like to try this when it has a chance to marinate overnight first and then do it on the rotisserie for the full effect. Still, it got good reviews from the fam. The skin was crisp and had flavor and the meat was juicy and tender. The reason for only 4 stars is, the rub itself was good but it didn't totally knock my socks off. I might tweak some of the seasonings for a better balance and outcome as it speaks to our particular taste buds (e.g.: more garlic powder and black pepper and maybe rub with melted butter instead of oil). Worth the try and will look forward to making it again.
