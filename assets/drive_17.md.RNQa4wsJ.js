Sprinkle pine nuts over the top.\\"","reviews":"This recipe is very good, but my Husband who was born in Kuwait, raised in Iraq and lived in Jordan for 6 years said they serve this dish with more lamb milk broth then this. Also you should have made clear that you do not use a flat platter but rather a bowl shaped dish, so the Pita bread soaks up lamb milk broth. But I was absolutely thrilled to find this recipe as it is hard to find arabic recipes online.
