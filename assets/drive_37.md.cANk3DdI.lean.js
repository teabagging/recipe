In a small bowl mix together the salt, ground black pepper, thyme, and rosemary; set aside. This will be your spice blend for seasoning the roasted potatoes and the duck breasts. Place cubed potatoes into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of your spice blend over the top of the potatoes. Toss the potatoes in the pan until they are evenly coated with oil and seasonings. Spread into a single layer across the bottom of the baking dish and bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven. While the potatoes are roasting, stir together the blueberries, water, apple juice, sugar, and jalapeno in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until the mixture has reduced to the consistency of syrup, about 10 minutes. Cook the pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy. Remove the pancetta to drain on a paper towel, leaving the drippings in the skillet. Add the shallots and the mushrooms to the hot skillet; stir and cook them until soft and just beginning to brown. Remove the shallots and mushrooms and set aside. Increase heat to medium-high and place the bok choy in the hot skillet. Stir and cook the bok choy until the leaves are wilted and the white stalk pieces are tender, about 5 minutes. Return the shallots, mushrooms, and pancetta to the skillet, turn off the heat and set aside. Rinse the duck breast halves and pat dry. Rub the remaining spice blend onto both sides of the duck breasts. Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat, when the pan is hot put in the vegetable oil and butter. Immediately place the duck breasts in the pan, skin and fat side down. Do not move the duck breasts until the skin is deep brown, about 5 minutes. Turn the breasts and cook until the internal temperature of the thickest part is 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) for well done. Remove the duck from the pan and place on a plate, covered with foil to rest for 5 minutes. While the duck is resting, place the skillet with the bok choy mixture onto a burner over medium heat to warm through. Slice each duck breast diagonally into 1/2 inch strips. Divide the bok choy mixture among four plates and drizzle each serving with 1/2 tablespoon of aged balsamic vinegar. Arrange the sliced duck breasts on top of the bok choy mixture; ladle on blueberry sauce. Serve with oven-roasted potatoes on the side","reviews":"Yummy recipe the blueberry sauce was good but took a long time to have the consistency I wanted >1 hour. I had no drippings from the pancetta so used so, but the mushrooms made some liquid as they cooked.  Cooked the duck 10 minutes each side.

Sprinkle beef strips lightly with salt and black pepper, and sear the meat in the hot oil until well browned on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes, working in batches. Do not crowd beef. Transfer beef to a plate. Reduce heat to medium, and cook the shallots until they start to become tender, about 2 minutes; stir in ginger and cook 1 additional minute. Stir in the curry paste, and fry 1 more minute. Mix in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil, scraping up and dissolving any brown flavor bits from the skillet. Stir in the coconut milk and fish sauce. Increase heat to medium-high, and return beef and any juices to the skillet.

Mix in the lime zest; sprinkle with cilantro. Serve with lime wedges","reviews":"Delicious, quick and uncomplicated dish! I was surprised at how good this was. I made it with out zucchini since I did not have any. Like another reviewer, I used some orange and yellow bell pepper. IMO, it was probably a better choice. I recommend increasing the red curry paste to 1 T. It is the star of the dish and is the basis of the flavors. DO NOT SKIP THE FISH SAUCE. It adds depth and balance. If you cannot find it, substitute some anchovy paste. I did not have any cilantro, but hubs does not care for it anyway. The lime zest at the end, paired with a squeeze of lime juice at serving time adds a beautiful finish. My side was Jasmine rice cooked in the remainder of the chicken broth I used for the curry. Next time I may serve this over cellophane noodles or udon noodles.
