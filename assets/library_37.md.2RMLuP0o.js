I've never served it to my kids, and this is the first time in 16 years of marriage that I've made it for my DH.  <br/><br/>That said, if it were only me ranking this, I'd give 5 stars.  DH said 3, one DS said 4, the others weren't sold on it.  I cut them into small bites - definitely smaller than ping pong balls - and let them go the full hour.  I also liked the very small (burnt?) pieces that were crunchy.  I like that the small pieces lost their texture (which is a big problem I have with cauliflower), and had the dark, roasted flavor.  I also salted after roasting - in addition to the salt in the oil.  I tried without, and it definitely needed it - and I don't usually salt food.  <br/><br/>Be warned - they shrink A LOT!  Started out with a very full pan, ended up with less than half when they were done.  So have I extracted any bit of nutrition by cutting them small and baking till dark and mostly crunchy?  Possibly, but I hope not.  I can definitely see me making this again for myself.  And I can guarantee this is the only way cauliflower will be served in our house.

Although Food.com has hundreds of recipes for roasted cauliflower, Cauliflower Popcorn - Roasted Cauliflower is the only one that cooks the cauliflower at a high temperature for a long time which caramelizes the florets much more than the other similar recipes do. My head of cauliflower was huge, yet I only needed to use three tablespoons of oil. Instead of discarding the stem, I peeled and sliced the stem into half-inch-thick rounds and roasted it with the florets. Although the florets resemble popcorn, they really taste like French fries. Like a perfectly cooked French fry, this cauliflower is crispy on the outside with a soft creamy center. Surprisingly, I actually prefer the taste of this cauliflower to fries (and I LOVE fries!)

I didn't have orange extract so I substituted 3 Tbls of OJ concentrate, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract for zing, and of course orange peel for the lemon. I was a bit distracted when I made these - I saw the 3 Tbls of juice in the ingredients and added them to the dough, which made it a little moister than it probably would have been. And somehow I missed chill over night - I wanted cookies today. I divided most of the dough into 3 logs wrapped in plastic and put them in the freezer until firm but not hard. I had a little leftover not chilled which I tried as drop cookies - those are the little round ones in the picture, not bad, but a little doughy for me. I sliced off rounds from the logs and lightly pressed them with a glass, using a piece of parchment in between so they didn't stick. I also tried making a ball of dough and pressing which came our exactly the same. I'll just chill the dough a little next time, scoop and press.

I even doubled the batch. Mine turned out very messy when I put them together, but they were good. I would try to roll them a little tighter. It didn't help that I didn't read close enough and didn't pull the 4 rectangles apart on my first batch. When I took them out I put them in a crockpot on warm and it went well. I think the cream cheese made these really good. I didn't use the full 1.5 cups of cheese and they were fine. Edit: I've made these a few times now, and though they get a little putzy I've found a little easier step so they don't fall apart so much. I fold them down in half, and then in half again. Rolling is tough...They don't come out the prettiest, but I'm much saner in the end.

Do everything else as written. It makes about 20 muffins, but as stated in another review, the muffins don't rise much. Also when I made my last batch I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I used one cup of lowfat (2%) milk with three tablespoons of white vinegar added to it, and let it sit to curdle for about a half hour or so. The muffins tasted just as good as usual. As for the bitterness of the orange rind, I often will use thinner skinned and smaller valencia oranges, maybe three smaller ones, and find that these work well. Sometimes I'll only use the skin of one orange, but I think if you process the oranges well, the skin becomes very tiny chunks that add to the taste of the muffins. These are a favorite in my home.

I have been making it over and over again just realizing today that it was the first recipe I ever found on Recipezaar. \\n\\nI love Amaretto/Almond Biscotti.  They are my favorite.  I have made these too many times to count.  Everybody that has tried them has loved them and is amazed by my baking abilities (it's not difficult at all).  To make my biscotti more flavorful, I use almond extract instead of the liqueur because I think the flavor and aroma are more pronounced after baking.  I also use 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of the almond extract again for flavor and aroma.  As for the almonds, I use whole unblanched almonds that I roast slightly, before adding them to the recipe to draw out their flavor. The biscotti still slices easily.\\n\\nMy kids love them with a hot chocolate and so do I!

This is SOOO awesome. I made this as one of the desserts to bring to my mom's tomorrow, and my family will be lucky if there is any left to arrive with me! I'm just kidding....this recipe makes a TON. So, here is what I did: I used mini chocolate chips, brown sugar, and I also added 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the brown sugar and butter mixture, all on the suggestions of other reviewers. Since the recipe directions don't specify, I *simmered* the brown sugar and butter on medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until it was a caramel color and bubbly (I have never caramelized anything on the stove before this, so I wanted to pass that on). I also used a custom mix (that means I shook it around in a tupperware) of finely chopped pecans and almonds, instead of walnuts. When I was done making the candy, I popped it in the freezer for about 15 minutes, and then it was easy to break apart. I forgot to grease the foil (probably because I was SO excited to make this), but it was still not bad to carefully lift off. Greasing would be good, though. I was going to try Skor bits, but I'm glad I didn't, because those would have been TOO sweet, and this is a sweet treat!

Everything went smoothly until I put it in the oven.  The only ingredient adjustment I made was the amount of olive oil, so if you try this don't cut down on it.  I baked this for over 10 minutes in a preheated oven and preheated tray.  Although small bubbles formed it did not get brown.  I left mine a bit on the thick side, maybe that had to do with it.  It came out a bit soft like it was supposed to.  I used the 4 recommended herbs too.  They tended to fall off the baked bread, maybe because I cut back too much on the oil.  The herby taste was nice though, and it went well with a yogurt based dipping sauce.
