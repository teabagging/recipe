These turned out surprisingly well after all the mishaps they endured at my hands!

So I worked another packet of yeast (quick rise this time, all I had on hand) into the dough with another 1/4c water and a little more flour. Well, it rose, but by that time it was time for bed! So I wrapped it in plastic wrap (sprayed with pam) and put it in the fridge overnight. This morning I saw it had risen more during the night, split open the plastic wrap partway, and the parts exposed were hard as a rock! LOL... anyway, I cut off those parts, made my pretzels and baked as directed (except without toppings - like to put mine on afterward)- except I BARELY greased the baking sheet - another BIG mistake! These babies stuck like glue and I ended up ripping off the bottom 1/4 of each pretzel trying to pry them from the pan.

Drizzle some Tapatio hot sauce (or another smoky hot sauce--the smokiness is key) over the top of your open-face sandwich.  The sauce adds a nice spicy, tangy, smoky depth to the other flavors in the sandwich.<br/><br/>3.  Use some peppery dark greens instead of watery romaine or iceberg.

I used regular Hellmann's Mayonnaise, plus I only added 6 tablespoons of sugar, a 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar (instead of red wine vinegar), 1 tablespoon of diced onion, and I only added 1 teaspoon of celery seed, which I thought was more than enough.

I had never tried banana with sweet potatoes and loved the idea.  I took heed of Juli B's Hive's experience of her potatoes being a little dry and went to the Zaar Kitchen Dictionary.  On the strength of what I found there, I added a couple of teaspoons of orange juice with the egg yolks. That, of course, also added another citrus flavour.  YUM! I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and the second time I made this, I added some chopped walnuts at the end of step five. I love nuts in recipes if I can squeeze some in.

I love things like chicken and dumplings and chicken noodle soup, so this was right up my alley. I didn't have a whole chicken, or even any bone-in chicken, so I just defrosted about 4lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs for the meat. In hindsight, I probably would've been fine with half that amount, but DH liked having the extra chicken in it. I added an extra carrot and celery stalk because I love the veggies (that, and I just had them in the fridge). I couldn't find the frozen egg noodles, so I used a bag of homemade dried egg noodles instead. Before I added the flour, I was worried that the finished dish would have a floury taste, but I was totally off. I actually think I could've added a couple more spoonfuls of it, because the sauce didn't thicken up quite as much as I was expecting (I was thinking gravy, but it was more like a hearty thick chicken noodle soup). No matter, though, because it's yummy! This would be great for a cold-weather family dinner with some warm biscuits, since it makes a huge pot (maybe because of the extra chicken I added?). I'll definitely be using this recipe again, thanks for posting!

I made this today and followed her blog recipe but wanted to rate it here so I could remember what I did differently :) There is one step missing from the original that is important for me - after removing the meat from the bones you add the bones back to the broth and simmer for 45 minutes before adding the veggies (remove the bones before adding veg). This will add flavor and calcium to the broth. I also added Penzey&#039;s Ruth Anne&#039;s chicken seasoning to the chopped deboned chicken before I put it back in the soup. That and a nice amount of salt added just the right touch of flavor for us. I didn&#039;t thicken the soup, personal preference. I loved the color the turmeric gave!

Anyway, I deviated a bit from the recipe in that I used beef broth (that was all I had) and I lightly salted the chicken breasts during cooking. I used about 5 slices of bacon.

Dueto what I had on hand, I used 2T dried parsley instead of fresh, used half and half instead of milk.  Also added a sprinkle of dried oregano and sweet basil.  This made about 26 medium sized meatballs but my package of gound turkey was a little over 19 ounces. Baked in oven on parchment paper lined cookie sheet at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.

Two jars would have probably been better and saucier.  High simmered for 15 minutes, low simmered for 15 minutes more.  As good if not better than beef meatballs.

I am a self made cook. One thing I would change would be the noodles they really need to be Chow Mein style, Yakisoba noddles work as well. I am pretty sure Panda express fries their noodles or uses noodles that have been previously fried. When making the noodles I have found that cooking them lightly works best. Then you finish cooking them in the mixture.  I also put less sugar than what they call for. I have also had to double the sauce they call for on the rest of the ingredients. I do not own a wok but that is the best way to cook it right. The veggies should be lightly cooked( to simulate this using a frying pan add the longer cooking veggies first cook with half of the sauce. add all veggies until they are all lightly cooked but not soft(still slightly crunchy). Remove from heat. Refry the noodles separate with sauce then add it all the the mixture and serve. These are my suggestions. Oh also you should not use toasted sesame oil. it has a distinct flavor not found in their Chow Mein. I saw another Panda recipe that called for un-toasted Sesame oil and  Vegetable mixed( that is more accurate I think). I have even added crushed sesame seeds and vegetable oil and it has turned out pretty good."},{"name":"grandpa higginbottom s popcorn balls","steps":"mix vinegar , water and sugar in a large saucepan', 'cook until brittle when dropped in cold water', 'add butter and vanilla', 'make sure you have bowls of ice water on the table , which has been covered with newspaper', 'pour candy mixture over a very large bowl of popped corn', 'stir mixture with a large wooden spoon', 'coat hands with butter', 'working quickly , form balls with your hands', 'if you burn your hand , put directly in ice water'","description":"my family made these popcorn balls every year for halloween.....as did my father's family and his father's family before them. a real family tradition! i don't give them out anymore but still make them every year for friends and family. serving size is for one batch but two brown paper shopping bags full of popped corn will make approximately 150 popcorn balls. younger children should be very careful because they can burn their hands when making these. teenagers are much more suited for the job! enjoy!","ingredients":"vinegar', 'water', 'sugar', 'butter', 'vanilla'","review":"i thought this was pretty good"},{"name":"grandpa joe s cucumber salad","steps":"peel and slice cucumbers very thin', 'place sliced cucumbers in a bowl of salted water and soak for an hour', 'drain and squeeze cucumbers dry', 'place in a colander and let drip dry for an hour', 'after an hour , and the cucumbers are somewhat dry , mix in the previous made dressing', 'add the sliced onion and the paprika', 'add your favorite italian dressing', 'salt and pepper to taste', 'let sit in refrigerator a couple of hours then serve', 'yum'","description":"my hungarian grandfather made this all the time with his homegrown cukes. i'm carrying on the tradition. this is a great summer very tasty treat by itself or as a sandwich.","ingredients":"cucumbers', 'onion', 'paprika', 'salt', 'italian dressing', 'salt and pepper'","review":"I followed the recipe exactly and I'm sorry but nasty is the only word that comes to mind when I ate this.

After frying the duck I removed it from the wok (I don't like it too cooked, so I could increase the temp. Followed the rest of the instructions and added the duck just before serving. BF said it had the fried rice taste but a tiny bit burnt, which could have been a wok problem. Inspite of the honey, it wasn't sweet and the garlic wasn't that strong. I felt it lacked sth to totally convince me. I think I might try adding some ginger. Otherwise a nice recipe, a good combination to get all necessary foodgroups into small children.

Our broiler didn&#039;t cut it, so I usually pan cook the chicken, or boil it. Either way, you are going to shred it.\\n- Slice all veggies (we sometimes throw a zucchini is there, or some jarred sundried tomatoes) before cooking. \\n- Once the veggies &amp; sauce are ready, I toss in the chicken, let it warm a bit, then the pasta, let it warm together if necessary, and then serve. \\n- We don&#039;t like a lot of spicy heat, so I usually do 1/2 Rotel, 1/2 stewed tomatoes. I also find that I usually want more than one jar of Classico sauce.
