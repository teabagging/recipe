I really liked the flavor and it baked up beautifully.  I doubled the recipe and made 3 - 8 x 4 loaves.  I was assuming that the original recipe was meant to be made in a 9 x 5 standard loaf pan, but this isn't stated and I think it would be helpful.  I also found it unusual that the wet ingredients were added to the dry (most of my bread recipes are the other way around).  After step 2, the mixture was was very dry and it was hard to incorporate the ingredients in step 3 plus I was worried about overmixing.  I think next time I make it I will combine all of the wet ingredients and then add the dry until just combined so the batter doesn't get overmixed, which can tend to make the finished bread tough.

I started searching on this site for other ideas which were not way out, and not salads either. Yours won. I decided not to award stars, because stars would have been misleading! I printed your recipe to take to the kitchen, then realised that the recipe really needed extras! There seemed to be too much liquid used, first of all!! (Unless I miscalculated, which is why I'd rather not leave stars).  I changed your recipe in the following ways,  ... so how can I leave stars?!!  I did not have enough green onions, so used a small amount of chopped sweet onion. I also added a small teaspoon of a wet mixture of mild hot pepper/garlic/ginger (from a shop), which was barely discernable.  The onion and extra flavours were first fried in a tiiiny amount of oil, and then I added the skinned and chopped tomatoes, I simmered that for about 7 minutes, and only THEN I added the chopped green beans. I  flavoured the dish with sea salt, black pepper and about 1/2 teaspoon sugar (essential for flavour here!).  Did not use any water. Maybe your recipe missed out a step: shouldn't the beans be drained after cooking, and before adding the chopped fresh tomatoes? Because freshly chopped tomatoes cook up watery!  In any case, and with adding the pepper you have in your ingredients, this was eventually a very nice side dish.

The sauce would be great w/o it, but the cream really adds a smoothness and richness to make it feel just a bit more like a special meal type of dish - a notch up from the every day marinara.  Everybody really enjoyed it.   I didn't do much different - but I did use loads of fresh basil, instead of dried, and threw in a couple extra cloves of garlic and some red pepper flakes. I also added some freshly grated Parmesan at the end.  This paired very nicely w/ Italian Baked Salmon (recipe #272021), some homemade Italian bread, and steamed broccoli.  A real winner of a meal!  My only complaint is very minor - it's probably just me - but I didn't care for the pasta leftovers the next day... loved it the first, not so much the 2nd.

Also, as a first-time attempt, 3 pounds of chicken breast was quite a lot to manage. I couldn&#039;t understand the reference to a &quot;small loaf pan&quot;, since I was sure 3 pounds of meat would need quite a large pan. Perhaps it would be easier to understand if this were changed to &quot;small loaf pans.&quot; I actually used one quite large, but narrow, loaf pan, piling the meat up in the center. It took about 1 hour and 40 minutes to cook through. I added salt and some pepper and put red pepper on the bottom of the pan. I can understand that making a batch this size could be convenient, but do recommend that people trying first, halve this recipe or even make only one third. I needed to grind the meat (I was using frozen meat that I chopped up) in the food processor in batches, and did find the finished amount rather unwieldy.

My first attempt I botched through my own foibles: I put the lemon juice in with the sugar and water before boiling/simmering, which resulted in a very off-urine smelling compound that went straight down the drain. After procuring more lemons, I went for it again, following the instructions all the way until adding in the juice. The issue was that the syrup that was produced here was quite viscous after cooling only slightly, resulting in the lemon juice resting largely on top of it. Additionally, I forgot to actually stir it for about a minute, which didn't help. I was eventually able to stir the two parts together, but this resulted in a consistency very akin to that which the lemon juice had on its own. I don't doubt it will function in its intended purpose, nonetheless, even if it's a little less syrupy than simple syrups tend to be. I just wanted my experience to serve as a warning to the less cooking-savvy bartenders out there, like myself -- watch this batch carefully. Lastly, despite the recipe saying, &quot;let cool to room temperature,&quot; before adding in the lemon juice, I recommend letting the simple syrup cool only to the point that you can comfortably touch the pot. Boiling/stirring such small quantities of sugar and water produces a fairly viscous simple syrup, and if you let it cool too much the lemon juice may not mix properly with it. However, if it's still simmering or very hot when you add in the juice, you run the risk of overheating the lemon juice and ending up with a very unappetizing mixture like the one I got on my first go around."},{"name":"peanut dressing or dip  1975","steps":"mix all in a blender or food processor', 'make salad of choice pour on dressing and garnish with roasted peanuts'","description":"this is a very simple dressing. use it as a vegie dip, green salads, spinach or coleslaw.","ingredients":"peanut butter', 'olive oil', 'plain yogurt', 'gingerroot', 'fresh lemon juice', 'honey', 'spring onion'","review":"A devotee of the potato, I am always on the lookout for new ways to prepare baked fries.

Never thought dumplings could be a 20 minute dish.  The boyfriend loved them!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I uploaded a picture, if the coloring looks a little different than the others, it&#039;s because I chose to substitute beef stock instead of water, just as personal preference.  It blended great, and made the broth super rich (maybe a con to some, but we love rich broth). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I also added a little flour to thicken it up.  When I make dumplings from scratch, I always end up with thick broth, as loose flour tends to fall off the dumplings and thicken the surrounding broth.  The added flour mimicked this &quot;from scratch&quot; effect, and the boyfriend was none the wiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m still loyal to my grandma&#039;s backwoods Kentucky dumplings, but they&#039;re so time consuming.

These were our favorite new cookie this Christmas! Easy to make and super chocolately with lots of peppermint flavor.  I chose to drizzle with melted white chocolate and sprinkle with crushed peppermint candy cane mixed with a bit of red decorator sugar.  They were extra pretty, very easy and added a nice flare to my trays.  Highly recommend this recipe - I am filing it in the Christmas cookie keeper file.

Due to pantry item availability, I had to make a few changes (keeping with the recipe as closely as possible, though). I thought I had some elbows, but no dice, so I used the next closest pasta cut I had -- whole grain rotini. I used orange bell pepper in place of the red (there was enough red with the roasted red peppers already anyhow). I didn't have any plain old-fashioned mayo on hand, so I used a mixture of Japanese Kewpie mayo and Hellmann's mayonesa instead (yeah, yeah, I always buy the weird stuff, lol). Good call with using the tuna packing oil in the salad -- it adds good flavor, and it didn't make the salad oily at all. If I tried it without seeing the recipe, I never would've guessed that the oil-packed tuna was undrained.  I sprinkled a bit of lemon pepper on my portion, too, which was very nice. My only complaint that kept this from being 5 stars was that I kind of felt like it was missing something. I think I was looking for the sharp/salty element that is always in my mom's macaroni salad (chopped onion and sliced green olives), so a bit of chopped onion probably would've done the trick for me.

I also agree with another reviewer that you should not be tempted to leave the cinnamon stick out of the meat sauce, it really does add a subtle but vital flavor to the sauce -  just don't forget to remove it.  I have a very picky Irish family who never seem to grow tired of the same old meat & potato dinners.  I decided not to tell them that this was a Greek dish in case the kids would refuse to try it.  Good strategy; they all licked it in them!  My super-picky niece even had seconds - wow!  I did evenually reveal the nationality of the dish and taught them to learn its proper name.  Now that they can pronounce pastitsio  correctly they've requested that I make this again for them soon.
