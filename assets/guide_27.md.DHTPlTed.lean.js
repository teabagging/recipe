I reheated the fish directly on my cooking rack in the oven (350 degrees) and placed a cookie sheet on the rack beneath to catch the oil that dripped off (so reheating also reduced calories!).  As with all deep frying, it seems the trick is to keep the oil hot-hot-hot so that the batter doesn't absorb all that oil, however, waiting time and again for the oil to regain optimum temperature between batches makes a fish fry/donut fry/corn dog fry even MORE time consuming, so the trade off is putting up with more calories or a slightly oiler-than-optimal meal every once in a while!

It had a really great flavour, and we ate it all up!

My only other criticism would be that unless you're serving this as a tiny starter there's no way it serves 8 people. Three of us made the recipe as given, expecting to feed ourselves and have a one-person-portion left over (as we feel risotto should have at least 500kcal per portion!) and actually we ate it up AND had pudding. Still, really great flavours :)\\n\\nEdit: Having come back to this some months later I've realised that this is quite an ambiguous recipe.

I&#039;m an old hand at making risotto.  We didn&#039;t find that the tofu cubes added much of anything.  Perhaps if they&#039;d been marinated and then browned and added at the end with the rest of the &quot;sofrito&quot; the flavoring, which are the mushrooms that were browned in the beginning.  On the other hand, adding some silken tofu to the end, rather than lots of butter could give it a much creamier texture and something I might try the next time I make a risotto.  And while I used the &quot;baby bella&quot; mushrooms, for another attempt, I would add some dried and reconstituted porcini mushrooms to the mix.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making risotto isn&#039;t difficult or ambitious.  The usual order of risotto making is to make your &quot;soffrito&quot; first, that would be something that is usually sauteed beforehand that has a lot of flavors, mushrooms, bell peppers, sausage, etc., and then removed from the pan.  Onion is usually added next to the olive oil and butter.  Saute until translucent only, don&#039;t brown.  Add the rice and coat the grains thoroughly.  In fact, they should become somewhat translucent with a hard bit in the middle.  Have your stock simmering in a pot next to you or at least hot from the microwave.  Add the first addition, often wine, and deglaze the pan with it.  The pan should be almost dry before you add the next ladle of stock.  Figure one addition every 5 minutes.  It should take you about 20-25 minutes total to make this.  Stir the rice as it absorbs the stock.  This does not need to be constant but at least a few seconds out of every  minute within the 5.  To tell that it&#039;s ready for the next addition, draw your spoon though the rice.  It if stands up on either side and stays put for about 15 seconds, it&#039;s ready.  I call it the &quot;Red Sea Test.&quot;  When the rice is al dente, turn the heat off.  The last addition goes in, along with the sofritto and any additions such as the peas.  Stir madly. Add some extra butter and good finely grated Parmesan cheese.  Stir again.

However, since the freshly grated stuff is so strong, I would say half as much of the nutmeg and cloves would have worked great for this recipe.  I'll try it that way next time and see what happens.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I ground mine in the blender almost into pecan butter and my crust was good but it wasn't the same.  Next time I'll think chop rather than grind.

SO flavoursome and SO addictive. The blend of flavours was superb and having chopped pecans in the cheeseball as well as coating it: a brilliant touch! Several times I heard comments such as I've just have to have some more of this cheeseball! Predictably, it didn't last long! And yes, a couple of people were anxious not to leave without the recipe. The only changes I made were to use finely chopped roasted red pepper in place of the green pepper (always so superbly flavoursome) and to add 3 cloves of minced garlic and some chopped fresh basil. When you make this, make sure that you not only drain the ingredients thoroughly but that you press all the moisture out of them. I find that putting ingredients such as the pineapple, onions (and garlic) in a small colander and pressing down on them several times till there is no more liquid to be released does the trick. Wonderful recipe, MsSally, which I'll be making for several times over the next few weeks: thank you for sharing it! And I'm going to experiment some more with possible variations. I'm thinking I'll make one with a couple of tablespoons of well-drained canned salmon and dill.

Even *I* could do them, and, as my 8yr old said, they are heavenly.  I've made them easily 7 times over the past 9 months to the delight of my family and friends.  My only advice: on your first try, follow the recipe exactly.  Don't try to speed it up with tricks or swap out ingredients with lesser fat or alternate sugar.  Just make it as is the first time through, and you will not be disappointed.  <br/><br/>Keep in mind that you are making your own dough here, and how it rises is subject to your own environment (altitude, humidity, etc).  The yeast I use needed proofing with 1/4-cup of water which then required more flower for the dough (and might have resulted in slightly fluffier and moister rolls).<br/><br/>Hot out of the oven (30 minutes is a MAXIMUM cook time.  Check on them after 20), these are heavenly.  If you have any left after people attack them, cover them once they cool. Heat one for a few seconds (10?) in the microwave to bring back that yummy gooey warmth.<br/><br/>Once you have made these once, then play with the recipe.  I've started making them smaller by rolling out to 22x12, spreading the cinnamon mixture,, cutting it down the middle with a pizza cutter, rolling from the middle to the outer edges to make two cylinder rolls, and then cutting in to 1 1/2 pieces.

As mentioned, most of this recipe is spent waiting: waiting for the ingredients to come to room temperature and waiting for the rise.  The mixer does most of the work on the dough, so everything else just helps to make these fool proof. Always check the expiration date on your yeast just to be safe so all your hard work isn&#039;t wasted on yeast that won&#039;t rise.  Make sure everything is brought to room temperature before starting to make these.  I only added 3 1/2 cups of flour to the dough for the right feel to it.  To help it rise, I cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then put a dish towel on top of this too. I turn on the oven to about 250, and sit the bowl on the warm stove to rise.  The warm stove helps the yeast puff up, even if you have a cooler house.  It doubled in about 2 hours.  After I sprinkled on the cinnamon/sugar mix, I rub it onto the dough to make sure it was an even coat and mixed well.  They rose a little in the fridge, but the hot water pan puffed them right up.  I was waiting for the family to get up, so they were in the oven with the hot water about an hour.  I only baked them about 25 minutes, but I started checking them at 20 minutes.  I &#039;tweaked&#039; the icing with a bit more cream cheese since it was a little too sweet and not enough cream cheese taste.  My husband and the In-Laws raved about these for breakfast.

I have never cooked fish or meat in this manner (with the egg following the flour mixture), but I ended up LOVING it.  I also liked that the egg seemed to prevent the flour from coming off in the pan, so less blackened bits accumulated and there was very little smoke associated with the frying process.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup corn starch.  My only complaint is with the sauce. I found it to be WAAAY too lemony and also the wine was overpowering.  Perhaps this was because I added cornstarch to the seasoning blend and used less flour?  Thankfully I didn&#039;t pour the sauce over all of the fish, so we were able to eat only the fish, which was good all by itself.
