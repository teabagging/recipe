Cook the garlic, serrano peppers, and tomatillos on the hot griddle until toasted and blackened, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes for the garlic, 10 minutes for the peppers, and 15 minutes for the tomatillos. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool. Heat oil in a small, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Using kitchen tongs, fry the tortillas individually, turning them once. They shouldn't be in the hot oil for more than 5 seconds per side. Remove excess oil with paper towels and keep warm. Remember that the hotter the oil, the less that the tortillas will absorb. Place the toasted garlic, serrano peppers, tomatillos, and the water in a blender and blend until smooth; pour into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve the chicken bouillon into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. The sauce shouldn't be too thick. Soak three tortillas in the sauce, one at a time, for a few seconds, fill them with shredded chicken, sprinkle the meat with some of the sauce, roll them and place them seam side down on a pasta bowl. Spoon a generous amount of sauce over them and top them with lettuce, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese. Pour a little more sauce over the whole thing if desired. Repeat the procedure twice more. Serve immediately.\\"","reviews":"These enchiladas are fantastic!  The recipe is easy to follow and my children LOVED IT!

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season water a pinch each of salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper to the water. Boil ribs in seasoned water for 20 minutes. Drain, and let the ribs sit for about a half an hour. Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly coat the ribs with barbecue sauce. Cook the ribs over high heat for a 5 to 10 minutes on each side to get a nice grilled look to them. Place grilled ribs in a slow cooker. Pour remaining barbecue sauce and one bottle of beer over the ribs; this should cover at least half of the ribs. Cover, and cook on High for 3 hours. Check ribs every hour or so, and add more beer if needed to dilute sauce. Stir to get the ribs on top into the sauce. The ribs are done when the meat is falling off the bone. The ribs were cooked completely in the first process, the rest is about flavor and texture","reviews":"Fantastic, easy-to-read and easy-to-use recipe. Straightforward and came out with some delicious ribs. This is a very basic recipe, and as with most BBQ you can add whatever you want to flavor these ribs. I added them to the slow-cooker and then put them over my ancient weber BBQ over lump charcoal and got some good hickory smoke chips going. They turned out fabulous.'"}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:q,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(t=>{const a=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return t.name.toLowerCase().includes(a)||t.steps.toLowerCase().includes(a)||t.description.toLowerCase().includes(a)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},G={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],_={key:0},V={key:1};function N(t,a,o,m,r,s){const h=w("PoemCard");return i(),n("section",null,[a[3]||(a[3]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 recipe 🥳")])],-1)),e("div",G,[a[2]||(a[2]=e("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(e("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":a[0]||(a[0]=l=>r.searchQuery=l),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,r.searchQuery]])]),e("div",E,[(i(!0),n(u,null,p(s.filteredPoems,(l,g)=>(i(),v(h,{key:g,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[1]||(a[1]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(i(),n("span",V,"Loading...")):(i(),n("span",_,"See more"))],8,O)):C("",!0)])}const Y=c(L,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-20adf936"]]),Q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/38.md","filePath":"drive/38.md"}'),U={name:"drive/38.md"},K=Object.assign(U,{setup(t){return(a,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[I(Y)]))}});export{Q as __pageData,K as default};
