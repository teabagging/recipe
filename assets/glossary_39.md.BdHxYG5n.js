Next time I would roll teaspoons of dough into balls and flatten them with a fork to give the finished cookie a more uniform appearance. On the plus side, I want to congratulate Chef*Lee on writing such excellent instructions for this recipe. Maybe next time I'll be able to follow the ingredients list too; I had no dark brown sugar, no plain butter, no baking powder, no juice, no vanilla, no dried goji berries, no white chocolate and no sweetened coconut. I replaced the dark brown sugar with light brown sugar and extra treacle, replaced the butter with unsalted butter, replaced the store-bought baking powder with an in-a-pinch concoction I found here on Zaar, replaced the juice with brandy and vanilla with cherry liqueur, replaced the goji berries with glace cherries and the white chocolate with dark chocolate (chunks). Finally, I've never come across sweetened coconut in the supermarket so I used ordinary desiccated coconut. Another comment, and in no way a criticism, is that I must have made my cookies quite a bit smaller than Chef*Lee intended because I used half of the dough and yielded 46 cookies (the other half of the dough yielded 77 heart shaped cookies!).

I&#039;ve done my best to modify my recipes to use the self-rise flour.  We&#039;ve actually been enjoying the difference in the  consistency.  All that to say, I used a little more buttermilk to insure that it was still moist.  It was still a tad dry, but that could still be the difference in flour, idk.  I also added 2 tsp cinnamon for extra flavor (our bananas around here in the midwest have been lacking in flavor lately).  The cinnamon was a perfect addition.

The texture is moist and dense and lusciously chocolate (it reminds me a little of the Tasty Cake cupcakes I grew up with, but even better), very brownie-ish for those brownie addicts among us.  I think you can sub some of the flour varieties out pretty easily, especially the starchy ones like tapioca (I substituted potato starch for that one, since tapioca is made from yuca root, which is used like a potato in Central & South America).  The recipe came together easily and pretty quickly.  We do not even use a topping on this cake, as it is irresistible just as it is (however, for my grandson's special day we used a Cool Whip frosting made with chocolate pudding and a little less milk than the recipe called for).  To be honest, we just weren't counting on everyone's wanting seconds and thirds the way they did!!  We are not big on keeping sweets around the house, but I will admit we had to make this one again the next day for those who didn't get enough the first time around (it is awesome cold out of the refrig as well--had to cut it into bite-size guiltless chunks to keep it from disappearing within the hour).

I used the best cocoa - Callebut - I could find. Trust me on this one, the brand of cocoa you use makes a lot of difference. I added a raspberry sauce filling between the layers and iced it with a simple cocoa whipped cream and garnished with fresh raspberries. It was the best chocolate cake we have ever had. <br/>An FYI to those baking this for the first time, TRUST the recipe! The batter seems too thick, gummy and gloppy (for lack of a better word) when you mix it and add it to your baking pans (I used two 9 rounds) and is hard to spread around the pans, but it bakes up perfectly.

I think next time I might go heavier on the cinnamon and/or lighter on the nutmeg - the nutmeg came through heavier than I liked. I put this in a single crust instead of a double so I had a little filling left over.  I used that as a topping for oatmeal.  The pie was great but the oatmeal was even better.  :)  Now I know what recipe to reach for the next time I have apples that need using up, and like kittencal, I plan to freeze some in the future.

The other apple pie recipes I have tried, where the filling is cooked inside the pie crust, always seem to be either  too dry or too runny.  Not a problem with this recipe.  This apple pie has a rich tasting, thick, creamy filling that clings to the apples within each slice. \\nI had 10 Granny Smith apples to use, which came to 9 cups of apple slices.  I doubled all the ingredients but did add an extra 1/2 cup of sugar (1 1/2 cups total) because these apples were very tart.  I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon (2 teaspoons total).  I used a total of 8 tablespoons cornstarch for doubling this recipe.  Instead of apple juice, I used apple cider heated in the microwave until very hot. IMO, the apple cider/juice is what really puts this recipe over the top above others.  After the filling thickened, I separated it into two 4-cup containers.  After cooling, I used 4 cups for my pie and froze the other for later use.  At 425 this pie cooks quickly and I had to use foil to cover the edges of the crust after the first 10 minutes when I moved it to the center rack. Be sure to cut air vents/slits on your top crust because this filling will bubble up.   The bottom crust was perfectly done and the top was golden brown after another 20 minutes in the oven.  This is the best apple pie I have ever made and my dh gave it a big thumbs up.
