I think, due to my changes, they didn't quite turn out like intended, but smell, texture and flavour are 10 stars for my tastebuds! First of all I used gluten free flour, which shouldn't have affected the texture too much. But then I realised that I was run out of margarine, so I had to use shortening instead of butter. That, I suppose, made most of the difference. I melted the shortening and mixed in the chocolate, which was very dark chocolate, then slowly poured and whisked the mix into the eggs which I had beaten with the sugar / rice syrup I used. After adding the flour, I had a fudgy glop. Heavenly smell and good to work with, but very funny texture! Then I first panicked because the cookies refused to spread, so I flattened them while baking...

I tried Scrambled Tofu (#71419) and I liked it so well that I was sure that I'd like this.  I actually made 1/4 of the recipe (that is, one serving), but found that I had enough for 3 egg salad sandwiches. The serving size for this recipe is really pretty big- 1/2lb tofu per serving seems like a lot to me.  I had to leave out the parsley because I had none on hand and used dried dill.  I was cautious with the cayenne at first, using only half the amount- but tofu is so bland, I ended up using the full amount and could have stood for more!  I did use real (albeit organic) mayo.  I think that for my tastes, the spices do need to be knocked up... doubled even, I think.  I ended up adding about twice the recommended amount of turmeric and added some lemon juice for a little tang.  I don't think that a Tbs or so of relish would go astray in this recipe either.  Great basic recipe, though!  As with egg salad, there is a certain degree of adjusting for personal taste, but in appearance and texture this is right on the money!  I am wondering if adding a bit of nutrional yeast like in the scrambled tofu wouldn't be good... BF loves egg salad, but I do not love boiling and peeling hard boiled eggs (stinky!) so I think this will be a great alternative that is both healthier and easier!

I would say that 1/4 of the orange (or even a bit less as this just absorbs the flavor of the orange during boiling and simmering) would be about right. I also doubled the amount of risotto rice, as I just wanted it to be more ric-y than cream-y (in other words more thick than liquid...worked perfectly). Used a large granuel brown sugar (like the white sugar but brown...think sugar in the raw, not traditional brown sugar, which I think would have been tastier)and found that this required the .8 liter of milk box that is sold here in Israel(the full milk is the brown one that is advertized as the one you put in your coffee, like half n' half, but it's cream in the milk and not an artifical substance) and one of the whipping cream boxes and a bit of regular milk that I had on hand. This was just like a tapioca pudding. Absolutely delicious, decidant and delicate in flavor. I'm not a big fan of the texture of tapioca, and I still liked this. The presentation was lacking, though, as a few stirs of the chocolate (I used dark chocolate chips) just made it look not well enough blended and not rippled. Perhaps I stirred too much. I should have waited until all the chocolate was melted (ug, more patience) and then given a few stirs (only 3 or 4 needed to get the rippled effect), but still, then all the chocolate seemed to be at the top of the pudding, with hardly any going through to the bottom, which bothered me, because if I wanted that, I would have just melted an even layer on top of the pudding. We had this hot, warm and cold and by far it is best hot or warm. The cold made it more cake-y (again, I doubled the amount of rice) which just wasn't my thing. It was still quite good that way...but it was WOW hot. This reheated fine in the oven...microwave probably would have been fine too in a pinch, I just wanted an all over even heat so I kept it in the pot I'd made it in but put it in the oven with a lid. I did feel that this took some time for the rice to get to the right consistancy (on the road to disinagrating and VERY large with a thick porrige type sauce)...could have been a half hour after boiling...and that at times it was lible to boil over (did once!!!) and other times it seemed perfectly fine (as it was closer to being done), but regardless, I had to stir a LOT. This meant not searcing for other recipes on recipezaar and nursing the baby standing up. But well worth it. Really. Served this to 3 different families for a holiday of milk foods/products and it beat out it's rival cheesecake hands down. Was PERFECT!!!\\n\\nEdited to add: I made this again with the correct amount of rice and it was delicious too! I also used milk chocolate (last time I used dark) which gave it a very smooth flavor, though I still prefer the dark. I also used half an orange with a thin rind and the amount of orange was perfect. I also (finally) managed to make this with out it boiling over by stirring every 10-30 seconds. Took closer to 45 min to cook. Maybe longer. Be patient and wait until the rice is discinigrated and not chewy for a different more even and smooth texture. Again, delicious."},{"name":"fuddruckers hamburger seasoning by todd wilbur","steps":"combine all ingredients in a small bowl', 'sprinkle on hamburger patties before cooking'","description":"from www.topsecretrecipes.com another one of those great restaurant copy-cats! enjoy.","ingredients":"paprika', 'ground black pepper', 'salt', 'dark brown sugar', 'garlic powder', 'onion powder', 'ground cayenne pepper'","review":"I have used this same recipe before and was quite delighted how well it came out.

I cut a piece of dough from the chilled ball and roller it at once using a marble rolling pin on a smooth ceramic tile surface. It rolled beautifully but it was still to soft for the cut outs to be lifted from the tile. They tore and couldn't hold the heart shape that I had cut them into.

The crust was very easy and delicious for a pastry-challenged chef like me.

My milk had spoiled so I used half and half, and mixed it with the 3 eggs.  While pouring over the other ingredients, I stopped when the level neared the top; I had over 1/2 cup of liquid to discard.  The end result was a &quot;solid&quot; rather than &quot;creamy&quot; quiche, which turned DH into this recipe&#039;s biggest cheerleader. The flavors were incredible!

When you go back to the roots, in a regional sense, there are two types. The white or Cajun gumbo from southwest or south-central Louisiana, and the red or Creole gumbo which developed around New Orleans where tomatoes were more readily available. This recipe is neither. <br/><br/>This simply isn%u2019t gumbo.  It is a very bland vegetable chicken soup that leaves anybody trying gumbo for the first time thinking%u2026 it is really strange that all those rednecks down on the Gulf Coast love this stuff so much? Please folks gumbo is really good and shouldn%u2019t have it%u2019s good name sullied by something that isn%u2019t gumbo. This chicken soup might be a great tummy warmer in the dead of winter in Wisconsin but nothing more. <br/><br/>I made this recipe just to see if the recipe I%u2019ve used for years was simply too complex for no good reason.  It may be a bit more complex but there is a reason that people have made gumbo this way for 150 years. This concoction as it stands tasted a lot like hospital food. The things that are missing here that remain critical to creation of authentic gumbo are, to name a few: thyme, basil, cayenne pepper and although thickened with okra a little file%u2019 powder would add the final essence of a really tasty gumbo. Deglazing the trinity with a little white wine would also add body and character. Lastly a really thick dark brown roux is a must to carry the complex and wonderful mixture of ingredients in gumbo to the next level.  I gave this recipe a one because it is chicken soup, and I like chicken soup, but unless renamed I would give it a large negative number if they were available for forgeries."},{"name":"funshine fizz  non alcoholic punch","steps":"blend the 2 juices and the sherbet until smooth', 'pour into a pitcher and stir in the club soda', 'serve in collins glasses'","description":"this is a creamy, fruity, fizzy drink  that would be great to serve at a brunch or party. great for adults and kids alike!","ingredients":"orange sherbet', 'pineapple juice', 'orange juice', 'club soda'","review":"Responding to Pawpaw Mac: This recipe was not supposed to be for gumbo!

slumgullion. \\nsome say slumgullion has an irish origin, some would say it‚Äôs italian. the truth is that american slumgullion is most likely a fusion of both. slumgullion in its genesis was generically defined as a ‚Äúwatery stewthat certainly does not describe, in the least, what my mom prepared for us. in fact, this particular slumgullion doesn‚Äôt resemble a stew at all ?it‚Äôs more akin to a form of johnny marzetti, only better, in my opinion, and prepared on the stovetop instead of in the oven. mom‚Äôs recipe was both delicious and hearty. and i should mention at this point that my family came directly from multiple generations of native appalachians, and so, mom‚Äôs recipe was inexpensive, used common local ingredients and, was very filling, all of which represent appalachian cooking caveats and additionally, necessary for us to stay within a tight family budget.\\nthis recipe, as i have listed it, takes my mother‚Äôs dish and incorporates it with a slight fusion influence of cajun, italian-american, midwestern, tex-mex and, of course, appalachian fare. all but the cajun facet are immediately apparent ?a second look, though, will reveal the cajun holy trinity of cooking: saut√©ed onions, celery, and green bell pepper.\\nand if you think that i‚Äôve gotten a bit wordy with the description of, and basis for, this recipe, it‚Äôs because i want you to know how much research and testing i‚Äôve put into it ?it‚Äôs not something that was simply ‚Äúthrown together? great thought was given to these ingredients, and many more which did not really benefit the dish and, thus, the dubious ingredients were eliminated from the recipe, a process which is often painful for any chef. but no one would have laughed harder at my efforts and description here than my own mom ?because my mom did throw things together and they always came out great. she was a natural-born chef but she was also a humble woman and would have demurred had you addressed her by that title.\\ni would caution everyone who tries this one to not shortcut the method, (e.g., shocking the cooked pasta in cold water), or you might end up with slumgullion mush. and dee514‚Äôs italian spices are integral to the dish ?since they work great in pretty much anything italian, (lasagna, spaghetti, etc.), make up a batch and you‚Äôll be very glad for it!\\nto summarize this tome of a recipe description, i‚Äôll state that i tried to do the same thing with this recipe as dvorak did with classical music when he wrote his new world symphony (no. 9), if you are familiar with that notable piece. if not, give that monumental symphony a listen as you savor the robust flavor of fusion slumgullion along with some buttered white bread. as a final note, do not for a minute believe that this recipe will result in anything sophisticated because it‚Äôs just plain good eatin?

I thought it sounded perfect for Valentinea?s day and Ia?ve never heard of toaster bread OR wine in bread batter. The cream cheese wouldna?t completely a?melta? into the rest of the batter, it stayed in tiny bits. For the jam I first put it in a small bowl and stirred it fast until it was smooth, then I dolloped it on and swirled it in. That worked well. I checked it at 45 minutes and it was DONE. I would recommend checking it at 25-30 minutes. I did put in the red food coloring, but I would leave it out next time. I thought it was a funny color (my boss liked it though). I colored ALL the batter, but the bottom and edges came out of the oven just plain bread color! There was a bowl-shaped pink part. Weird! Anyway, despite the fact that it was a bit overdone, it was enjoyable! The edges were a bit dry, but the center had a wonderful texture and I liked the taste, sweet, but not too sweet. The bits of cream cheese didna?t seem to detract from the taste or texture. I ate it both cold and toasted (in a toaster oven), and it was good both ways, I think I prefer it toasted though. Thanks!

I was intrigued by the ingredients & the method but I was not sure what time of day to serve it or even what to serve it with. After having made it I think it is probably a breakfast item. It was easy to make, but the preserves did not distribute throughout the batter easily. Instead they all just sank to the bottom of the spring form pan. After baking it was very dark on top, but not burnt, & it had ballooned up in the middle & on one side. When cooled & sliced, the preserves were pretty much glue at the bottom of the bread but I was still able to remove the slices to a baking sheet without much trouble. I broiled most of the slices, leaving some in the just baked stage, for about 3 minutes each side & then had DH & DS taste them. We had some mixed reviews. The bread was just okay, for me. I did not really get much flavor. It was not as sweet as I wouldd serve for breakfast, but it was not savory enough to serve for an afternoon meal either. DS (15 yrs old) liked the bread toasted, DD (18 months) ate it both ways & DH liked it better just baked. I do not necessarily think that the recipe went wrong; I just dona?t think it satisfied me enough to make it the same way twice. I may make it again but I will try adding some vanilla or almond extract & maybe replace the preserves with dried berries instead.

My husband couldn&#039;t eat it. We literally could drain off liquid from our bowls. So I suggested to him that we stir it up a little bit to get the pudding from the bottom of the pan towards the top so we could throw it back in the oven.
