I am not wild about carrot soup ever -- and the family and I are wild about this!!!  I've made it 3 times in the last month and my sweetie has asked me to make double batches. The orange juice is really important (though I once subbed tangerine juice which was great).  I also added dried orange peel into the pot (it gets blended so don't worry about the consistency).  Instead of cream, I used a cup of plain yogurt -- very yummy, less calories, more tangy.  I also used more ginger (2x or 3x as much),  a few stalks of celery, and garlic. Dress it up at the end with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove or allspice (or combos), and add some of those to the soup as well (after the blending, near the end).  I also serve it with a dollop of yogurt. Such a good winter soup -- a new regular with lots of flavor and lots of health."},{"name":"grilled honey mustard chicken","steps":"in a bowl mix mayonnaise , mustard , honey , salt and pepper', 'in a ziplock bag , place chicken and pour honey mustard mixture over chicken , reserving 1 / 2 cup', 'let marinate at least 2 hours , overnight is even better', 'remove chicken and discard the marinade', 'grill chicken about 10 minutes on each side', 'the last few minutes brush with reserved honey mustard'","description":"this is the best home made honey mustard recipe i have found.  very simple and great taste!","ingredients":"boneless skinless chicken breast halves', 'mayonnaise', 'dijon-style mustard', 'honey', 'salt', 'pepper'","review":"This was easy and tasty.

During curing, colors and flavors change and acidity increases.  \\n\\nWash cucumbers thoroughly.  Be sure to remove and discard a 1/16-inch slice from the blossom end of fresh cucumbers. Blossoms may contain an enzyme which causes excessive softening of pickles. \\n\\nSoft or slippery pickles can be caused by several things (If spoilage is evident, do not eat):  1) Salt brine too weak during fermentation.\\n2) Cucumbers stored at too high a temperature during fermentation.\\n3) Insufficient amount of brine.\\n4) Pickles not processed properly (to destroy microorganisms).\\n5) Moldy garlic or spices.\\n6) Blossom ends not removed from cucumbers.\\n\\nScum on the brine surfaces while curing cucumbers is not uncommon.  Wild yeasts and bacteria that feed on the acid thus reducing the concentration if allowed to accumulate. Remove scum as often as needed.\\n\\nFully fermented pickles may be stored in the original container for about 4 to 6 months, provided they are refrigerated and surface scum and molds are removed regularly. \\n\\nCanning fully fermented pickles is a better way to store them.

The recipe needs a little clarification: I used 8 medium mushrooms and non-marinated artichoke hearts for the recipe and actually only used the recipe as written a guideline.  In the flour mixture I used some granulated onion, granulated garlic and Susie Q's Santa Maria seasoning (basically salt and dried parsely and a few spices) and pepper.  For the oregano, I used dried and sprinkled it on the mushrooms as they cooked and I used fresh rosemary but just threw the rinsed sprigs in to be removed before serving ( I added those just prior to putting in the oven)  For the garlic I used the minced refrigerated variety (a great invention!).  As I was cooking it I wondered what to serve with it, and I also noted it was all very bland in color.  So I had 2 very large red potatoes that I sliced in half lengthwise and then across in 1/4 inch slices and sauted these at the end of the mushroom cooking for a few minutes.  To compensate for the addition, I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth and a little more salt and pepper.  I was a little concerned as I started topping the chicken that it may need more seasoning so I added some smoked kosher salt and maybe a teaspoon of italian seasoning.  I did think it still could use a little more color for eye appeal so I added some red pepper strips (1 pepper) and some brocolli florets (about 2 cups) at the last 5 minutes of cooking.  The result of this recipe with the changes I made is very much like a chicken stew and with the peppers and brocolli it was a very colorful and delicious dish.  With all of the additions I made, it would serve at least 6 as a one-dish meal.  Next time I make it I think I'll add even more liquid to make more sauce for the potatoes.

My celery did not get all cooked done even after the extra 5 minutes. Since my first review I've made these without the celery and you wouldn't even know it flavor wise they taste just the same as they did when I made them with the celery. My 4 yrs newphew woofed it right down but the 6 yrs old niece still didn't like them. I have since tried using Jack Daniel's Hickory brown sugar BBQ sauce and these are just as good. I'm guessing any BBQ sauce would make these taste great. I've even doubled the recipe and it turns out great everytime. Overall these were very good and we will have these again with no doubt. Thanks for posting a great recipe.

SO, because I'd doubled the recipe I ended up putting 1/2 cup in - and it came out pretty damn good (even though I am probably sending myself into an early grave with all the sugar)!  Didn't have cans of tomato sauce (I know, Jude, shame on me) so I used 2 cans of tomato paste instead. As other reviewers said, I toned down the celery to 2 ribs total. Made it again with 3 ribs and didn't taste a difference. Before browning the turkey I added butter and kind of caramelized the onions a bit with some minced garlic before adding the celery - then turkey. Because tomato paste is obviously more dense I didn't drain the turkey after browning in lieu of having to add water (mmm - fat!) I only use Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce. Period. And now I have a reason to buy it in bulk at Sam's Club. Used 3/4 an onion total (didn't want to overdo it with the onion). Everything else was the same. On subsequent go at it I added some diced mushrooms to the mix and it was even better.

I thought the amount of mustard added was a bit much. It was quite potent, and that was the first thing I noticed/smelled after simmering the joes and removing the lid. One other thing I wanted to mention here, since I did doubled the recipe, I found I only needed to add 1 stalk of celery, diced, and I thought that was more than enough for this recipe. I did add some diced green bell peppers, as I like peppers in my sloppy joes. Jude, I would like to make your sloppy joes, but when I do, I will reduce the amount of mustard to a 1/4 teaspoon.

I was hoping for more of a tomatoey taste, so I added an extra can of tomato soup, some garlic powder, and even added a little A-1 steak sauce to give it a richer, less barbequey taste.

Absolutely no comparison to the canned stuff; this recipe is delicious!! Only changes I made are as follows: I chopped the onions and celery in the food processor before adding to the meat, so that they would just melt into the mixture and add their flavor without being chunky; then at the very end, after tasting for seasoning, I added 2 Tbs onion powder & 2 Tbs garlic powder for some depth of flavor, and added a very small pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for a hint of heat just because we enjoy it, but the recipe is fantastic exactly as written. Served on fresh buns that I buttered then toasted in the toaster oven. Note: I browned the meat very slowly over med/low heat in order to break down the meat and cook it down into a smooth consistency. As a result, as we were eating the sandwiches, I realized this would make a GREAT hot dog chili. Yumm!
