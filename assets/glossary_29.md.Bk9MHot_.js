I had exactly enough filling for one whole box of manicotti shells. I really liked the flavor that the cream cheese brought to the filling -- sometimes I find that pasta filled with pure ricotta cheese is just too, well, ricotta-y, but the cream cheese made this perfect. I didn&#039;t have any Paul Newman sauce, so I subbed in one jar of Barilla Traditional sauce and one big jar of Victoria marinara sauce. I think I ended up using more sauce than was required because the Victoria sauce was a Costco-sized jar, but it thickened up quite a bit in the oven, and we like pasta heavy on the sauce anyhow. I was initially worried that the pasta wouldn&#039;t soften enough if it wasn&#039;t pre-cooked, but it was just right after it&#039;s time in the oven (soft but not soggy). I could fit all but 4 of the manicotti in one big pan, so I put the last of the manicotti in a small (1.5 quart) Corningware dish.

I like the recipe as a concept but I'd have to make some serious adjustments to proportion and spices.  I used the two bags of frozen broccoli since this was a once a month cooking meal, and found there to be twice as much broccoli as I wanted.  The cream sauce was good, but not enough of it.  It's perfect if you only want the chicken to be creamy, but it left the broccoli totally plain.  I would double the cream sauce, omit the Italian seasoning and seasoned salt and replace it with roasted muchrooms or green chilis to add more depth of flavor.  I carmelized the onion and celery before adding the garlic and didn't use pimentos, though next time I'll try them.  The stuffing turned out somewhere between crunchy and soggy.  I would toss the stuffing with the cheese or put the cheese on top (for another flavor enhancer, toasty cheese is often a winner) for softer, or toast the stuffing in a skillet seperately for crunchy.  I will try this again with the modifications listed above.

I made it a few times, was extremely impressed and entered it into one of the county fairs in our area.  I won a Blue Ribbon!!!  This is exceptionally good and easy.  As mentioned...DO NOT exclude the roasting time NOR the butter.  I always use salted butter because it gives the candy the special flavor of salty/sweet.  I use the chocolate candy coating discs...sometimes light choc., sometimes dark.  It isn't necessary to use top of the line chocolate here.  The simple discs taste and set up great and the clusters always turn out perfectly.

YUMMY! While I could not find ham hocks that were not already cooked, I chose prok shoulder ribs for the meat.

But I just didn&#039;t want to buy a ham, it&#039;s just me in the house and large quantities of anything tend to go to waste. But next time, I&#039;ll get the ham. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I followed the recipe other than the meat, and added some red chili powder, turmeric, and cumin. I used a bit more onion and garlic, I don&#039;t measure those :) Added enough water to cover, and added about another cup and a half after about an hour. Really didn&#039;t need to add more, but, it didn&#039;t hurt. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Came out thick, like I like it, and tasty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an excellent base recipe as is, and the 15 bean mix is a must! (I&#039;m pretty sure my mom uses Lima beans only) But I would highly recommend using the ham hock, or left over ham. Other cuts of pork just don&#039;t add the flavor it needs.

But these were very easy and quick (compared to the traditional recipes). I tagged Recipe #185976 in Zaar Tag and didn't have 30-60 days to wait for a traditional recipe, so this one looked good and quicker. I blanched my lemons for 7 or 8 minutes, which was probably longer than necessary. The skins were quite soft after that. Also, I didn't have enough coarse salt, (only about 1/2 cup), so I supplemented with fine sea salt, and perhaps this made mine saltier than they would have been without? When I cut the 8 wedges, the lemon flesh was quite soft and I had to be careful in handling them lemons. I would be interested to retry this cutting into only 6 wedges. When I made the kebabs I rinsed the lemons and left the flesh inside. We had a friend over for dinner that night and he said they tasted good (and asked what they were). I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the jar in other recipes (I'll have to look for some). At some point I guess I will make a more traditional preserved lemon recipe for comparison.

My 1 pint Mason jar filled to the brim brought much speculation from family members. Finally the day arrived to infuse a new ingredient into a dish. Firstly, I timidly sprinkled the chopped rind over a salad. Uuummm pretty darn good. What next? Slipping these slivers of gold along with garlic under chicken breast, I was hopeful.
