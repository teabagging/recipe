I never cook whole chckens (due to diet and preference), so I used 2 med-large boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I used a 9x13 baking pan which I greased lightly with a mix of olive and canola oil.  I pared and sliced 4 small-med Russets, threw in 2 cups or so of partially thawed crinkle-cut carrots, thinly sliced one small onion, and used nearly 2 T jarred, minced garlic (that's supposedly the equivalent of 12 garlic cloves!)  I rubbed a bit of olive oil on the breasts and sprinkled with dried Thyme, but then I thought to try Recipe #179240 I made recently, since that also had thyme in it, so I used about 1 1/2 T of that poultry seasoning on each breast.  I also sprinkled some salt and pepper on the breasts.  I laid the garlic in the bottom of the pan, chicken breasts on top in the center of the pan and then the potato slices, carrots, and onions all around.  I sprinkled a tad more jarred minced garlic on top.  I used only 1 T of Smart Balance with Flaxseed Oil Spread and melted that when I mixed up a chicken bouillon cube and a cup of water in the microwave, then whisked a scant 3 T of bottled lemon juice in (I forgot I was only supposed to use the equivalent of a half a lemon not a whole one).  I sprinkled a bit more salt over all and a very generous amount of black pepper.  Covered with aluminum foil and baked at 425F for 30 mins, then turned the chicken over and baked uncovered for 30mins moe.  Due to my serious tweaking, the chicken was dry, but still flavorful.  The veggies were awesome.  Next time I'll marinate the chicken breasts and possibly adjust the cook time.  The only reason why my chicken was dry was because I did't used butter, and used a lot less of the Smart Balance, and my chicken was all white meat.  Bf said it smelled yummy while cooking.  This was good, and hope to make it again!

And thank you for posting it, I must say. My Folks are from SW Missouri and always used horehound candy medicinally.

My dad complained about it often enough that I searched for recipes and found yours. The horehound flavor in these candies is strong enough to choke you, so: Just right! Lol. I used white sugar, not brown - you really couldn&#039;t tell though, because it is too strongly flavored with horehound. &lt;br/&gt;To be perfectly honest, I used the recipe more as a guide than a rule. I used more leaves than called for (I grew the plants; seeds from ebay) and used fresh ones. I simmered the leaves for about an hour because I wanted to get all the good I could out of the plant. Do yourself a favor and DON&#039;T TASTE THE INFUSION. It brings new meaning to the word BITTER. I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m not a fan of bitter, so I don&#039;t like these drops and I would have to be very ill indeed before I was reduced to putting one in my mouth. Ugh.

I'm happy to say that my search is over.  These brownies are super easy, with a soft & chewy texture, not cake-like.  I made them for dessert last night and the whole pan (I used the 8x8 for thicker brownies) was gone by this morning.  They really are the can't stop eating them brownies.  :)  I do like to make brownies with frosting once in a while, but I loved not having to spend the time doing it unless I want to.  This recipe is just perfect for a quick brownie fix without a lot of time or ingredients involved.  I used double dutch processed cocoa and a stick of Imperial brand margarine in this recipe.  (I would usually use butter but DH accidentally bought margarine - & now I know how I'm going to use it all up!  LOL)  Thanks so much for posting your creation, No More Sweets!  I'll be using it again & again!

It calls for only 1/4 cup melted butter so the batter is very thick, and the finished brownies (I baked mine in an 8-inch pan for 20 minutes) have a nice crackly top, but the crackle is very thick and not shiny, unlike typical brownies. However, they are absolutely delicious, chewy and fudgy, and remind me of the best boxed brownies (which was always my goal - to make homemade brownies that are as chewy and tasty as box mix brownies). However, I just wanted to double check - is the 1/4 cup of melted butter correct, or is it supposed to be 1/3 or 1/2 cup?

This is a great combination of flavors. I would add a kafir lime leaf with the broth next time, or a squeeze of lime juice. Also, I wonder whether the amount of noodles is correct. Noodles are not usually measured in cups - I grabbed a handful of noodles, and that seemed to work out well with the quantity of liquids I had.

I usually use more pecans than what's called for (about 1 1/2 cups). Make sure you bring the mixture to a FULL boil (it will be all foamy and boiling up).

I made these last year for family &amp; again this year as part of a spread for St Paddy's day (spinach pancakes, smoothies etc) for Irish people who helped me with my house. Lamb Shepherd's Pie is authentic for most of the UK &amp; Ireland, particularly for Wales with our large export of mutton meat; we do have a large beef industry in North Wales as well though (for Cottage Pie). However, I do not eat mammals so I use veggy mince (called 'crumbles' here) so I don't care what I call it other than the mouthful of 'vegetarian mince covered with mashed potatoes - with apologists to all purists here (as I get irritated when criticised over generalisations EG saying Scotch Egg, when I use a nut mix, not meat sausage). I had no idea what biscuits were here last year, except it was obviously not what I thought it was C a very hard stick or other shape of flour &amp; sugar, baked &amp; eaten as a treat or offered to visitors. I used pastry; I did this year too even though I have since seen Southern recipes &amp; see that biscuits are what Brits would think of as scones C soft &amp; usually sugary served with butter, jam &amp; thick cream, though, without sugar, they can be savoury &amp; placed on top of a bake (instead of mashed potatoes) which we refer to as cobbler. I used pastry last year &amp; this year, my experimentation with Southern recipes having been postponed (the dough of U.S. biscuits &amp; U.K. scones are not always the same ratio of ingredients). Some want a sauce, the picture shows the mini-pies on a tray of salad leaves, obviously meant to be served at a buffet for St Paddys Day C cottage/shepherds pie can be served with anything, gravy usually, but, at a buffet, ketchup, mustard or mayo is fine, it doesnt have to be shown here. Historically, I was taught that the reason potatoes (and tomatoes too) were shunned in the UK was not so much that they were thought unpalatable, but that they were not mentioned in the Bible, there are references to this. Lastly, the description says that frugal peasant housewives looked for creative ways to use leftover meat. Peasant housewives did NOT have leftover meat in the 1700s; they couldnt afford it &amp; besides, agricultural societies can only support daily muscle meat for a small coterie of privileged people. Peasants, my grandparents, cooked stews of root veg on an open fire with PERHAPS a ham bone or meagre beef neck bones which dont cook well; this diet was common in coal-pit villages of 20th Century Britain &amp; America as well as with agricultural workers. Cheese on top is also a modern invention; my parents generation had bread with butter OR jam OR cheese C the thought of putting cheese on meat would have been outrageous!!"},{"name":"prego chicken parmesan","steps":"combine bread crumbs and cheese', 'flatten chicken breasts with flat side of knife to 1 / 2-inch thickness', 'dip in egg then in bread crumb mixture', 'in skillet , brown chicken in oil', 'drain on absorbent towels', 'place in 2-quart shallow baking dish , 12x8x2', 'top with sauce', 'sprinkle with cheese', 'bake , covered at 400f for 20 minutes or until done'","description":"this is so quick and simple for a fast weeknight dinner. i like to use the prego ragu chunky gardenstyle tomatoes, garlic, and onions sauce.","ingredients":"italian style breadcrumbs', 'parmesan cheese', 'boneless skinless chicken breasts', 'egg', 'salad oil', 'spaghetti sauce', 'mozzarella cheese'","review":"I made this for dinner last night and I thought the flavor was amazing.

And there was some wonderful browning and caramelization that added some real depth to the flavors.  The chicken poached in the juice in my case, and I did thicken it to a thin sauce before serving.  My own observation is that the chicken didn't soak upmuch flavor. That had me thinking next time I might season the breasts with a little salt, pepper and thyme and quickly brown them.  Also, I did not pound the chicken before baking and thinner cutlets might have better absorbed the great flavors.
