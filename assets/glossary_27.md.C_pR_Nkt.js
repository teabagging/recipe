I love fresh warm kettle corn (reminds me of Halloween in Salem, MA, because that's typically where I would get it), and I love cinnamon, so this was pretty much a guaranteed keeper! I have to admit, I was a little scared of trying this at first, only because of the cooking method. You do have to be careful when opening the pot to add the sugars, because those little suckers will come jumping out at you. To minimize the time that your pot lid is up, just dump the sugar in quickly and be sure to recover and shake the pan well for distribution. If you try to carefully sprinkle the sugar in the pan, you'll lose half of your popcorn. Because of all the cover-lifting, it took some time for the kernels to start popping again after each addition, and I did have a few more unpopped kernels than usual -- I was afraid to wait too long for the popping to start up again after the cinnamon sugar was added because I didn't want to burn and ruin it. The end product was yummy, though, and I would definitely make this again. My only change was that I realized after I dumped the spoonful of cinnamon into the sugar that I used the wrong measuring spoon (1/2tsp instead of 1/4tsp), but it's all good. I recommend allowing the finished popcorn to cool a bit before serving it, especially to children, because the hot sugar might burn sensitive mouths. Yummy, thanks for posting!

I was looking for a recipe that used a lot of items I had already in our fridge (tomato, green onion, salsa, cream cheese and sour cream, specifically). I wish I would have used a medium salsa instead of hot though because the intense spiciness overshadowed a lot of the good flavors in the dish. Instead of cheddar cheese I used a Mexican blend from the dairy section and I think that was fine. I used low-fat cream cheese and sour cream and  it was still very flavorful. For the chicken I used a lightly spiced rotisserie chicken from the grocery store deli section which was delicious. I also added sliced avocado on top and those crispy tortilla strips you can get in a bag for topping salads (I highly recommend adding both of these finishing 'touches' as well as the green onion and tomato the recipe calls for). This got rave reviews by my boyfriend (he had 2 servings, I had one, so we've got another 3 servings left for lunch tomorrow :-) Oh, most importantly I wanted to write that I forgot to cover my glass dish with foil as the recipe says to do and it still turned out great.

Personally, I&#039;d cut back the sugar a little, and substitute honey for molasses. Not that the bread I have in my kitchen won&#039;t get enjoyed. Just gilding the lily a little. I used all the rye meal and all other ingredients in the listed quantities, except the white flour. I used bread flour, and added some in beginning, when the recipe said to, then added everything else, and finished with the rest of the flour. The dough was becoming stiff, so I used only about 3 2/3 cups flour, total.

I found that the raw garlic in the stuffing added good flavor, but even finely minced some were still crunchy.  This a not good.  Next time I make this recipe, I will probably saute the garlic first to ensure no raw garlic crunch.

I have to admit that my first attempt wasn't very attractive, but boy did it taste great!  The issue I had was transferring it from the bowl to the baking pot - it was sticky, and since I let it rise in the mixing bowl, it didn't want to move!  The second time I made it, I floured it well and placed it in another bowl.  This time it was easy to dump into the pot, although I think I'll try GW's oat bran, or maybe cornmeal instead of flour to keep it from sticking.  **Update - I made it for the third time, only this time I used parchment and did the final rising with the dough on parchment, in a deep pan of similar width to my cast iron pot, sprayed it with PAM, and covered it with saran.  When it was time to transfer it to the hot pot in the oven, the parchment worked like a sling and made transferring it SO EASY because you just drop the whole thing, parchment and all, into the pot.  It came out gorgeous and sure tastes wonderful!  I like that this is a small loaf, which is perfect for us!  I actually brought this along for Father's Day, and it was the talk of the lunch!

We got the basic white breads down fairly quickly and wanted to experiment with sourdough.  We began making a starter from scratch and after of week and a half of feeding and nurturing it, it was finally ready so we started looking around for a sourdough loaf recipe to try and decided on this one due to the great reviews.  The ingredients were so few, in fact I am having a hard time remembering anything I have cooked or baked with fewer ingredients that I thought it may be bland.  No sugar?  No oil?  That&#039;s insane!  And I fully expected our first loaf to not rise, or bake into a brick, or be burnt due to our lack of experience with this type of bread....but it turned out absolutely perfect!  I set the dough out to rise before I went to bed, and my wife finished up with the baking while I was at work the next day. By the time I got home, between her and our kids it was nearly gone!  The crust was stiff and textured but not crispy or brittle, and the inside was dense and chewy but not hard or unpleasant at all.  And the taste was absolute heaven!  It hasn&#039;t even been a day since our first loaf came out of the oven and we have a double recipe rising for another batch tomorrow.

So, while I simmered the tomatoes, I sauteed the green onions, peppers, and carrot sin some olive oil.  When it said to add the spices, I assumed that meant garlic and parsley with the bouillon?  I also added a generous handful of Cajun seasoning.  After adding the cabbage, mushrooms, zucchini, and V8, I realized the celery never went in, so I added it then.  I also realized I didn't add the jalapeno peppers, which were probably included in step 4, so I added them then as well.

There was 5 of us and not much left to prove it. I used 1 flat cut and 2 point cuts. They weighed about 8lbs altogether. The most important part of this recipe is to brown the corned beef.

The only othere thing I did was to add about 3-4 tablespoons of red wine vinegar to the water and beer. I usually let my corned beef sit in some water and vinegar overnight in the frig to help cut some of the fat. But adding it to the cooking water was perfect. I used a counter top roaster oven for about 4 hours. You can take the meat out and cook the veggies in the roaster or pour the liquid into a large pot carefully and cook on the stove.

We absolutely love it, this is the only way I make pork and sauerkraut now.  My daughter-in-law went nuts when she ate it, she thought it was sooo good.  I have to watch the high sodium content so I rinse the sauerkraut several times and by the way the stuff in the bag is so much better than canned.  I also only use half of the onion soup (2 T.) again because of the sodium.  I used one of those little 5.5 fl. oz. cans of apple jusice in place of the water ( I didn't want so much liquid) and threw in some roughly chopped raw onion, probably about a cup. We love onion cooked with pork and sauerkraut.  I used western ribs trimmed of all visible fat and browned for our pork, again just a personal favorite and splenda brown sugar.  The reason I made most of the changes is because hubby has heart problems and this is one of those rare special meals to serve that he probably shouldn't eat.

For this recipe, I used 2-(12 oz.) pork tenderloins, and cooked them frozen, (yes I said frozen) and on high in my 6-quart size crock-pot, and they were done cooking within 3 hrs. While preparing this recipe, I also added the juice from one (32 oz.) bag of sauerkraut, as I can't see why others would drain off and rinse the kraut before adding it to any dish. It's the juice from the kraut which gives dishes more added flavor. This recipe calls for 2 cups of water, but I just added 1 cup, since I also added the juice from the bagged kraut. While I loved the way the sauerkraut tasted, my husband did not. My husband and I were surprised that the pork tasted bland, even tho the dry onion soup mix and juice from the kraut were added. I know this recipe says it's the slow, low cooking that makes a roast taste very tender and delicious, but I am a skeptic to cooking it for 24 hrs., especially in a crock-pot. For years I have always cooked pork roasts frozen, (yes I said frozen) in my crock-pot and on high for 6 hrs., and they've always turned out well. Perhaps if I were to cook them on low for 24 hrs., the pork would have been more flavorable, but like I said, I am a skeptic to cooking them in a crock-pot for 24 hrs. I'm sorry I can only give this recipe 2 stars. If the meat had more flavor, I would of given this recipe 4 stars.

It's so tasty and tender, and what a great way to use leftover cranberry sauce. Loved the cinnamon accent in the batter. I had considered leaving it out so I'm glad I changed my mind. I had jellied sauce to use up, and the middle layer kind of got incorporated into the batter-- I'm sure whole berry sauce, which is what the recipe calls for, would work better. If I had to use the jellied sauce again, I'd probably sandwich it between thin layers of nuts, or perhaps add a bit of cornstarch to it to hold it together better. This recipe worked well using mostly splenda (1 c) plus some brown sugar (1/4 c) and nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and I threw in a tsp of vanilla along with the almond extract because I love it so much. I really love coffee cakes with a crumb topping, so I made one using almonds, flour, and powdered sugar (bound with a bit of corn syrup and water) instead of the glaze this time around.

Tomorrow, I'll pick up the fresh chives and rosemary and add them in for the full flavour effect.  As it is, it's OUTSTANDING!  I'll make it often.

So, you&#039;re quite literally making egg rolls with this recipe. Which is of course, NOT yaki-mandu.
