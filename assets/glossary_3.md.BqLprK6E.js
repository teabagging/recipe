The first time it cooked over and made a giant mess. The second time I looked up some tips. You can use any regular cookie dough recipe to make cookie cake, but this one tasted great even when I messed up cooking it. For a cookie cake you preferably have a pan with sides, or put tin foil or a cookie sheet under it to catch messes. I thought about making a tin foil ridge underneath but forgot to try it. Make a slight indentation in the middle, like making a burger, so it is easier to cook through in the middle. Leave an inch or two of space around the outside of the dough to allow for spreading. Check it early and often.

The flavor is delicious and the presentation is quite impressive.\\nI made one change to the recipe -- at the last moment, I chose to use imitation crabmeat (roughly chopped) and it turned out just great.\\nI would make (DID make) three amendments to the recipe to make life easier for the next chef who takes this one on. The first is, an old chicken frying trick -- after dusting the stuffed breasts (pat them dry with a paper towel!)  with flour, let them sit aside for 1/2 an hour or so before further drenching and dredging. This makes the coating stick MUCH better to the chicken. I did this and all the coating stayed firmly attached during the frying and subsequent baking process. The second is, you will NOT need 7 cups of bread crumbs -- you can easily get away with half that amount or even less, keeping the other dredge ingredients the same. The third is, because I was using bone-in Breasts (I cut off the rib section), I increased the baking time to about 55  minutes and the chicken was still very tender and juicy.  \\nNow, as for flavor, this is the perfect meld of chicken and seafood (which can otherwise be tricky). I made up the filling on the night before and it was so munchable, I had difficulty resisting just eating it all on crackers! I will say that this is probably not a dish for kids who are enamored with McDonald's.

I followed the recipe as follows making one change of using only about half the paprika. Not because I was doing something from experience, but rather I am a new cook who hasn't used much paprika and was a bit hesitant to put the whole 3 tablespoons in, not sure what it would do to the taste since it was already looking and smelling so good. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe there is something missing (more than the paprika I left out). I'm sure adding more salt would help but instead of having to use a lot of salt I'm hoping someone else can figure out a good additional ingredient to push this yummy recipe to a 5. I made it with uncle ben's white rice (my new fav. rice) adding a spoonful of cream cheese to the rice when fluffing at the end. If you've never tried that it's really good! I would have liked to have a good vggie on the side too but couldn't decide on one so I didn't make any! Anyway it tasted so good along side the rice I began to mix it up all together spreading the sauce and fish throughout the rice. Gasp!! Just looked at the recipe again.  I think I figured it out-I left out the OJ!!!  Well, problem solved.  That prob would have given it a 5.  But hey it was still really yummy without.  Good stuff. Keep experimenting Chef Jay in Atlanta, you done good!

The liquid cooked down quite a bit when I baked it.  I'm not sure if the turkey absorbed some if it -- that's possible.  We both felt it could have used more of the sauce, so next time I will make another batch of the sauce and just let it simmer on the stove so we can put more sauce over the meatballs.

I made this at 8:45 this morning(as soon as I woke up) and it was ready by 9:15am. My kitchen smells beautiful with the aroma of this kheer wafting through it! Today my dad will be fasting all through the day(for the soul of my late grandma to rest in peace). He is permitted to have only certain foods through the day, one of which, is sabudana. He is not allowed to have almonds or raisins today and so I had to omit these from this recipe. In my opinion, raisins should really be omitted from this kheer or they could be made an optional ingredient. I used low-fat milk to make this(to make it slightly guilt-free);-)\\nAlso, I used 6 green cardamoms(powdered in my mixer) and not just 2. The quantity of sugar in this is perfect. One important thing that I'd like to mention is that sabudana does not get soft very easily while cooking - it is pretty stubborn an ingredient! So, I soaked it in boiling hot water for 10 minutes before using it for this kheer. Another thing what I did was to keep checking if it had softened through the cooking process. I had to bring it to a boil four times and only then it was soft. Only after it was soft, I added in the sugar and then cooked it till the desired consistency. I Promise, I will make this often and my dad will be absolutely pleased to wake up from sleep and find this on the dining table!

Used 2 - 390 gram bags (believe it was) of coleslaw mix so doubled the bacon and ranch dressing. The bacon amount was great but needed quite a bit more dressing to make it creamy. It was a great tasting coleslaw and could not stop tasting while mixing. The bacon adds just a bit of salty flavor that really fits in well with the ranch dressing. The problem I had was after I refrigerated the cole slaw overnight the bacon became soggy and not to appealing and the ranch dressing became very watery in the bottom of the bowl.
