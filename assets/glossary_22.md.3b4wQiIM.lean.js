I didn't think it tasted anything like the Yakisobas I have eaten in Japanese restaurants, but it was still good.  I found the directions to be a little confusing.  The amount of sauce is much, much more than you will need for this recipe.  You are only supposed to add 8 ounces of the sauce to the pan(the full recipe makes about 3 1/2 cups), but even that was way too much. I hesitated to pour in the full 8 ounces, and chose instead to add some gradually and test - about 1/4-1/3 cup was all I felt was necessary.  Also - if one dumps all the veggies, meat,noodles,and sauce into the pan at once,as directed, then the pan gets overcrowded.  I had to work in batches, even though I had a very large pan.  I think this would work better if the meat were cooked alone in just a little of the sauce first, then removed to a dish to keep warm, and then stir fry the veggies in small batches, adding a little sauce as needed, then the noodles, etc, and combining everything together when finished."},{"name":"beefy noodle bake","steps":"boil noodles according to package directions', 'meanwhile brown beef and onion till cooked', 'drain off fat', 'add sloppy joe sauce and soup to meat', 'stir to combine well', 'add mushrooms', 'cook til bubbly', 'combine cooked and drained noodles with meat mixture', 'stir well', 'place mixture in greased 2 qt', 'casserole', 'sprinkle top with cheese', 'bake at 350 for 25 minutes or until cheese is melted and casserole is heated through'","description":"a friend gave me this recipe and i thought the combinationof the sloppy joe sauce and the soup was weird. i had all the ingredients in the house one day and figured i would give it a try. it was quite tasty.","ingredients":"ground beef', 'onion', 'sloppy joe sandwich sauce', 'condensed cream of mushroom soup', 'mushroom', 'broad egg noodles', 'cheddar cheese'","review":"Very good Yaki sauce, I prepared 1/3 of the recipe and that was about right.

Let marinate between to 45-60 minutes because I had the time. Less time would NOT be detrimental, in my opinion. 4. Added one huge clove of garlic and 5. Added chopped onion to the stir fried vegetables. 6. Reduced the amount of noodles I added to the pan, by &quot;eyeballing&quot; the noodle-to-veggie-to-sauce ratio I preferred. Had I added all 8 oz.

Our microwave is 1200w, a high-powered one, so I cooked the bread for 4 min, then added another 30 sec. We had no problem with raw or gooey spots. I had been a bit unsure when I first added the oil to the dry ingredients, but worked with it long enough until it was small crumbs, like cutting shortening into flour, and it worked well at that point. The color and texture were a bit different that we were used to - a pale yellow color and very moist, almost spongy texture - but not unpleasantly so.

I substituted chicken stock for the water, simply because I had a big batch of fresh chicken stock in my fridge.  I also used alder smoked salt instead of plain salt to enhance the smoky flavour of the bacon.  Once the soup was finished, I found the sauerkraut made a bit of a 'tangle' on the spoon, so I quickly ran through the soup once with my emmerson blender to smooth it out a bit.

So I chopped up about a 3/4th cup and added it to the meat mixture as well.  I had instant brown rice (not the long grain) so the simmer time was reduces to only 10-12 min.

One other thing I changed was that I added 3 T Nuefchatel (cream cheese) to the cooked beef/tomato mix and stirred. Then added in cooked rice (used more than in recipe) and some cooked quinoa I had on hand.  Gave it a great creaminess without the heaviness of too much cheddar.

Also, lined each pepper with a slice of pepper jack cheese (cheddar would be good too) then added the beef mixture on and top and baked 25 min. Topped with another slice and returned to the oven for 5 minutes. I loved the idea of boiling the peppers before hand as that really perked up the color and crispness of the peppers.

He 'blanched' the peppers to soften them so that they would not break when stuffing. He also made a rice and ground beef filing first. You can add spices and other ingredients as you please. He then would take the uncooked ground beef and rice mixture and gently line the inside of each pepper and fill the bottom of the pepper to about 1/4. He then placed a large piece of WHITE extra sharp cheddar (use Kraft Vermont or other but it must be white). He finished filling each pepper with the raw beef and rice mixture. The poured about 1-2 TBSP of pasta sauce over the filled pepper and then placed another thick slice of white cheddar on top of that and pour more pasta sauce over that. He cooked it in the over covered for about 50-60 minutes where the rice would could in the ground beef drippings as well as the cheese inside would melt. Of course the cheese on top would also melt. I would recommend 90% - 95% beef versus the usual 80/20. You do not want too much fat. But the juices continue to cook the pepper as well as the rice. When served have a side of pasta sauce. When you cut open the pepper the White Cheddar cheese mixed with the ground beef and rice would just run. The White cheddar has a different flavor and chemically creates a very different flavor than the orange cheddar.

So easy and surprisingly my son enjoyed it. I did not use rice to make it low carb and when I stuffed the pepper I would alternate between beef and cheese -- so it is like a pasta but inside of a green pepper. Also I bought spicy pasta sauce and used that instead as it gave it a bit of a kick without it being overly spicy. Also I do not boil the green peppers, but put them straight into the over at the tempterature stated and let it cook for longer. Doing it this way softens the pepper just enough without it becoming mushy (which frankly, is disgusting). Oh and you don't have to use green peppers, if you want some color try red, yellow or even orange. One more change, I don't use cheddar cheese but either a two or three cheese blend.

Just wondering how you know what the recipe is supposed to taste like if you change it? I made it exactly the way the recipe said and we all loved it. I loved the tang from the Italian dressing and the full flavor of the Caesar. The Parmesan going on top before baking allowed it to brown perfectly. Looked great and tasted wonderful.

My family raved about it!  I altered the recipe slightly in the following ways: I used didn't toast the pecans to save time.  I used 10 Biscoff cookies instead of graham crackers, which ends up being 2/3 cup of crumbs.  I used salted butter because I didn't have any unsalted butter on hand.  I omitted the nutmeg since the Biscoff cookies have enough flavor to them.  And I used just 2 tablespoons of butter.  <br/><br/>Here's my method: I added whole pecans and whole Biscoff cookies to my Vita-Mix, then added the spices.  This saved so much time!  Then I transferred the mixture to a bowl and incorporated the butter and vanilla.  Once in the oven the crust browned very quickly so using untoasted pecans seemed to work out.  When I actually baked my pumpkin pie, the crust almost burned!  I had to cover the whole pie with aluminum foil to protect it.  Next time, I plan to bake the crust for a little less time prevent this from happening again. <br/><br/>Fortunately, my pie ended up being just a tad too brown, but not at all burned.  It was a wonderful twist on regular pumpkin pie.  The crust is very rich and I may add even less butter next time.
