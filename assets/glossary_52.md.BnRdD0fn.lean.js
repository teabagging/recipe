I used Bob's Red Mill Whole Wheat Pastry Flour in place of regular whole wheat flour. The amount of baking powder seemed off, and because I was almost out I only used one tablespoon of baking powder. My waffles came out light and fluffy with a great taste. Whole wheat flours vary immensely from brand to brand and depending on the density of the flour you might need to use all three tablespoons. of baking powder. I mentioned Bob's Red Mill Whole Wheat Pastry Flour by name because I've had great success in substituting it for white flour in most recipes ( I wouldn't use it in cakes where a fine crumb is desired). When using whole wheat flours it is important to let the batter sit for 10-15 minutes so the flour can absorb the liquid. Resist the urge to add more flour at first if the batter seems thin, it will get thicker with time."},{"name":"chocolate peanut butter terrine","steps":"make the chocolate peanut butter mousse--------------------', 'lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9 1 / 4-by-5 1 / 4-by-2 3 / 4-inch metal loaf pan', 'line the pan with plastic wrap so that the plastic extends about 2 inches beyond the rim of the pan', 'place the pan in the freezer', 'fill a medium saucepan one-third of the way with water and bring to a simmer', 'place the chocolate , butter and peanut butter in a medium metal bowl over the simmering water and melt', 'when melted , set the chocolate mixture aside , keeping it warm', 'in a 4 1 / 2-quart bowl of an electric mixer , using the wire whip attachment , beat the egg yolks at medium speed until wellblended', 'while continuing to beat , add 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a steady stream', 'remove the bowl from the mixer stand and place over a pot of hot water', 'cook over medium-high heat , whisking constantly until the mixture is thick and tripled in volume , and registers 140 degrees f for 3 to 5 minutes on an instant read thermometer', 'remove the bowl from the heat and whisk the mixture until it is room temperature', 'using a large rubber spatula , gently fold in the reserved chocolate mixture', 'in a chilled stainless steel medium bowl , using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium-high speed , whip the cream and 2 tablespoons of the sugar until soft peaks begin to form', 'using the rubber spatula , gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture', 'carefully scrape the mousse / terrine mixture into the prepared terrine pan', 'smooth the top with the rubber spatula', 'tap the pan on the counter to eliminate any air bubbles', 'cover the top of the terrine with the plastic wrap overhang', 'refrigerate for at least four hours until set', 'unmold the terrine------------------------', 'unfold the plastic wrap from the top of the chilled terrine , and use it to lift the terrine out of the loaf pan', 'invert the terrine onto a rack set on top of a cookie sheet', 'remove the plastic wrap from the terrine', 'glaze the terrine------------------', 'melt the chocolate and butter', 'whisk in the corn syrup', 'remove the melted chocolate from the double boiler and let cool for about 5 told minutes so it can thicken slightly', 'pour the glaze over the terrine , spreading it evenly over the entire terrine using an offset metal cake spatula', 'refrigerate until set , about 15 minutes', 'to serve--------------------', 'slice the terrine with a hot , dry knife into 9 even slices , and then again in half making a total of 18 pieces', 'place 3 pieces of terrine on each dessert plate', 'sprinkle with toasted peanuts over the top and sides of the terrine', 'garnish with sweetened whipped cream and chocolate curls'","description":"this dessert is really worth the effort.","ingredients":"bittersweet chocolate', 'unsalted butter', 'smooth peanut butter', 'egg yolks', 'granulated sugar', 'heavy cream', 'light corn syrup', 'sweetened whipped cream', 'unsalted nuts', 'chocolate curls'","review":"These were great!

I recommend putting some aluminium foil under the form, because some of the butter in the dough baked out and dripped into my oven.

I reduced the amount of red pepper to our timid tastebuds ( only half) and used 2/3 of the lemon juice.

Disappeared off the table at work in no time flat and lots of requests for the recipe.  I started following the directions exactly, but had to deviate just a little.  When making the base layer (cake, peanut butter, water and egg), it was SOOO dry that my mixer couldn't handle it.  I tried mixing by hand, but still no luck.  I added extra water (I didn't measure it, unfortunately, but I'm guessing it was between 1/4 and 1/3 cup extra) and was finally able to work with it.  One of my friends who asked for the recipe said she had the same problem and added one extra egg rather than the extra water, and it turned out perfectly for her.  Also, because of the problem I had with the bottom layer, I thought the chunky peanut butter may have been the culprit, so I used cream peanut butter in the frosting.  We found the frosting had a very strong, overpowering chocolate flavor right after putting it together (and I'm a chocoholic!).  However, the next day, the chocolate and peanut butter had blended together much better.  The overall outcome was mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmmm GOOD!  Thanks for posting.

I didn't have any fresh corn, so I used frozen Southwestern corn (the one with bits of red and green peppers and onion). I didn't have any parsley, but I added lots of cilantro. The ingredient list only calls for 2 cups of broth, but the directions indicate that you need 4 cups total (two with the pureed corn, two added later). I followed the instructions with the 4 cups, but the two cups added later were tomato-chipotle flavor rather than the chicken. I also tossed in some leftover chopped turkey that I wanted to use up (that way, DH couldn't complain, what, no meat?). I added the heavy cream, too, but I think the soup would be just as good without it. I topped each serving with some crumbled tortilla chips, the crumbled bacon, a bit of queso fresco and some chopped avocado.

'here it is:', '8-inch round cake pan , at least 2 inches high', '8-inch round cake pan with removable bottom or 8-inch springform pan', 'untreated heavy-duty jelly-roll pans', 'rubber spatula , offset spatula , and flexible 8-inch metal icing spatula', 'decorating turntable , lazy susan , or inverted round cake pan', 'ridged plastic shelf liner , freezer paper , or 055 mylar', 'parchment paper and waxed paper', 'making the cake:', 'position a rack in the lower third of the oven or just below the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350f fit the bottom of an 8-inch round cake pan , one at least 2 inches high , with parchment paper and set aside', pour the clarified butter into a 1-quart bowl and stir in the vanilla extract , if you're using it, 'the butter must be hot when added to the batter , so either keep the bowl in a skillet of hot water or reheat at the last minute', 'although the flour and cocoa were sifted before they were measured , they need to be triple-sifted together', 'sift or sieve the flour and cocoa together 3 times , then set sifter on a plate or piece of waxed paper and return the dry ingredients to the sifter', 'keep close at hand', 'whisk the eggs and sugar together in a large heatproof bowl or the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer', 'set the bowl over direct heat or in a pan of barely simmering water and heat the eggs , whisking constantly , until they are warm to the touch', 'remove the bowl from the heat and , working with a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whisk attachment , beat the eggs at high speed until they are cool , have tripled in volume , and hold a ribbon when the whisk is lifted', 'sift one third of the dry ingredients over the eggs and , using a large rubber spatula , fold in gently but thoroughly', 'when the color of the batter is almost uniform , fold in the rest of the flour-cocoa mixture', 'spoon about 1 cup of the batter into the hot clarified butter add fold together until well blended', 'spoon this over the batter and , using the large rubber spatula , gently fold into the batter', spoon the batter into the pan: there's no need to smooth the top or rap the pan on the counter , as is sometimes done with foam-based cakes, 'bake the cake for 25-30 minutes , or until top of the cake springs back when pressed gently', 'transfer the pan to a rack and let the cake cool in the pan', 'when the cake is completely cool , run a small knife around the sides of the pan to release the cake and unmold onto a rack', 'invert right side up onto a piece of parchment paper', 'preparing the chocolate:', 'the chocolate is going to be spread and then scraped into ruffles from four baking pans', if you don't have enough pans , you can make the ruffles in 2 batches, 'choose heavy-duty jelly-roll pans that are neither warped nor dented , neither nonstick non treated with special coatings', 'keep them close at hand', 'melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set in a skillet of barely simmering water , in the top of a double boiler over an inch of simmering water , or in a microwave oven sat at medium power', 'stir the chocolate regularly until it is fully melted', 'smooth , and 115f to 120f', 'hold the bottom of one of the baking sheets over a burner and , moving it back and forth , heat it until it is warm but not hot enough to burn your fingers', 'put the baking pan upside down on a flat surface and pour on about 1 / 3 cup of the chocolate', 'use an offset spatula to spread the chocolate thinly and evenly over the bottom of the baking pan: the chocolate will only be about 1 / 16 inch thick', 'refrigerate the pan for at least 30 minutes , or for as long as several hours , depending on your schedule', 'repeat with rest of the chocolate and the other baking pans', 'making the ruffles:', 'to shape the ruffles , work with one baking pan of chocolate at a time', 'remove a pan of chocolate from the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature to warm gradually until it is pliable enough to be scraped', 'place the baking pan on a counter in front of you , a short side braced against your body', 'hold the end of the blade of a then , flexible 8-inch metal icing spatula in your left hand and , with your right hand , grab the blade close to the handle', 'you should have 4 to 5 inches of blade exposed and available for ruffling', using the top left corner of the pan as your staring point and imagining that corner of the pan as 12 o'clock , position your left hand in that corner , and your right at 2 o'clock, 'press the edge of the blade against the chocolate at a very shallow angle , as if you were going to slide the spatula blade under the chocolate', now slide the blade forward , moving your right hand down to 5 o'clock and then pivoting the blade to the left , all the way to the edge of the pan, 'as your right hand is moving down , so is your left , although not as far - your left hand will move down 4 to 5 inches', this is an important point - if you don't move your left hand down , you'll end up with tight curls of chocolate rather than ruffles, 'as you scrape and ruffle the chocolate against the blade and then make the pivot , the chocolate will gather against the blade -- use your left hand to pinch the chocolate so that the ruffles form a fan and the pinched part is a little handle', you've completed one ruffle, 'as you make each ruffle , place it on a parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate', 'when the ruffles harden , you can layer them between sheets of waxed paper', make 2 more ruffles across the top of the pan , using the previously scraped area as your guide -- the left-hand corner of chocolate will be your 12 o'clock point and the cleaned-off section of the pan your edge , or end point, 'make the next three ruffles just below', 'then turn the pan around to get to the chocolate on the bottom and make three more', with practice -- and ruffling takes lots of practice -- you'll get 9 ruffles from each pan, don't worry if you get fewer at the start, 'if , as sometimes happens , your ruffles crack or you get rolls of chocolate , not ruffles , it might be because the chocolate is too cold -- give it a few more minutes at room temperature before you try again', if the chocolate melts and gets gooey next to the spatula , it's too soft and needs a minute or two more in the refrigerator, when the temperature is just right -- smooth and pliable -- but you still can't get a nicely fanned ruffle , angle the blade differently as you scrape, 'for the syrup:', 'bring the water and sugar to the boil in a small saucepan , stirring to dissolve the sugar , and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes', 'remove from the heat and cool', 'add 1 / 4 cup of the eau-de-vie', taste the syrup and decide if you'd like a little more of the liqueur, 'set aside', 'for filling and wrap', 'beat the creme fraiche with the vanilla extract to soft peaks , then add 2 tbsp of the sugar , beating until thickened', 'taste and add more sugar if you want it , then continue to beat until the cream just begins to stiffen', 'cover and keep refrigerated until needed', 'assembling the cake -- cut the cooled genoise into 3 even layers with a long serrated knife', 'fit one layer into the bottom of a high-sided 8-inch round cake pan with a removable bottom or an 8-inch springform pan and brush the layer with syrup', 'place the chopped chocolate in a small bowl and whisk in the boiling water until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth', 'switch to a rubber spatula and folds 1 / 4 cup of the creme fraiche into the chocolate', 'fold in another cup of the creme fraiche and then quickly , before it hardens , spread the chocolate creme fraiche evenly over the genoise layer in the pan', 'moisten the second layer of genoise with syrup and set it , moistened side down , in the pan , pressing gently to level it on the chocolate creme fraiche', 'moisten the top of the layer with some of the syrup and top with an even layer of fresh raspberries , leaving just a bit of space between each berry', 'keep 1 perfect berry in reserve', 'beat the remaining creme fraiche until it holds its shape', 'spoon 1 to 2 cups of the creme fraiche over the berries and , using an offset spatula , delicately smooth the creme fraiche over and between the berries', 'moisten the remaining layer of genoise with syrup and set it , moistened side down , into the pan , again pressing lightly to set it in place', 'chilling the cake -- cover the cake and the remaining creme fraiche with plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 to 3 hours , or up to 24 hours', 'run a knife around the sides of the cake , then release and remove the pan or the ring of the springform pan', 'put the cake , still on its pan bottom , on a large piece of parchment paper and set the cake on a decorating turntable , a lazy susan , or a large inverted cake pan', 'making the wrap -- using ridged plastic shelf liner , freezer paper , or 500 mylar , cut a strip 26 inches long and 3 / 8 inch wider than the height of the finished cake , about 3 inches', 'place a larger piece of waxed paper on the counter in front of you --this is your drip sheet -- and put the strip on the waxed paper', 'melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over an inch of barely simmering water or in a microwave oven set at medium power , stirring chocolate once or twice until melted and smooth', 'the chocolate should be between 115f to 120f pour the chocolate down the center of the strip , spreading it with an offset spatula across the entire strip and beyond -- let it run over a bit onto the waxed paper', 'slip the point of a small knife under one edge of the chocolate-coated strip and grab the edges of the strip with your fingers', 'slide your free hand under the strip and grab the other end', 'lift the strip and fit it neatly around the cake , positioning it so that the chocolate side is against the cake', 'press one end

I've gone over to the Jack in the Box site for all the ingredient list and compared side by side to this recipe, and you nailed it!!!  This really does taste like the original or the closest thing to it.  Those that purport to be copycat tacos do not have the vegetable protein and soy grits included.  I made this with regular grits since it's hard to find soy grits and it came out just as good.  Also many add beans as already pointed out by another reviewer, but I suspect beans are added to make the beef texture smoother without adding vegetable protein - so in an effect it is taking the place of vegetable protein which beans are since vegetable protein is normally made with soy beans.  Great taste too - thank you so much for posting this.

When I saw this recipe, I jumped for joy as I had already tried the other one and it wasn&#039;t even close.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the adventure, I decided to get the exact ingredients listed.... $50 and 3 days later I had either ordered the ingredients online or went to the store.   As $50 would buy me 100 tacos, lets see if this is worth it:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day 1:   I spent 3 hours in the kitchen making the meat and preparing the corn tortillas (I doubled the recipe).  I ended up with a little over 60 tacos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day 2:  After freezing overnight, I deep fried them and added shredded lettuce, cheese (borden brand) and ORIGINAL taco sauce that I picked up when I was in CA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results:   I think that they were close to JITB, but a little bit sweeter tasting meat.  I had to reduce the oil temp between 300 and 325 degrees (for 2 1/2 min) in order to fry the tacos longer because with 3 Tablespoons of meat, deep frying for 1 minute caused them to still be frozen inside.  Speaking of, 3 TBSP meat is way too much - in order to be completly authentic, you must skimp on the filling as I&#039;ve never had JITB tacos where the filling squishes out the other end.   For my second batch, I put in 1 TBSP meat per tortilla and I&#039;ll see what happens then.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, very awesome - thanks for posting the recipe!"},{"name":"chocolate scotcheroos","steps":"cook corn syrup and sugar in a large pan over medium heat , stirring to dissolve the sugar', 'bring mixture to a boil', 'remove from heat', 'stir in peanut butter', 'mix well', 'add cereal', 'stir until evenly coated', 'pour into greased 13x9 inch pan', 'pat into place', 'melt chocolate and butterscotch chips together in saucepan over low heat', 'stirring constantly', 'spread over cereal', 'cool at least 45 minutes , or until firm', 'cut into bars', 'enjoy !'","description":"a good recipe for a childrens treat. found in the st george spectrum newspaper 5/2008.","ingredients":"karo light corn syrup', 'sugar', 'creamy peanut butter', 'crispy rice cereal', 'semi-sweet chocolate chips', 'butterscotch chips'","review":"Outstanding!

Jack in the Box tacos mimic retro deep fried tacos found in many small franchise mom-n-pop burger joints (Dairy Delight), etc going back 60 years. Before TVP. . Old days the pasty meat filling, the half slice American cheese, shredded lettuce, SAUCE, and yes old days chopped onion added BEST. Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP) is a soy bean filler invented in the 60's and in full scale use by the BIG FAST FOOD industry since the 70's. No doubt TVP is a main ingredient in Jack in Box Tacos. So if you prefer a chemically extracted bean filler in your taco meat, why not? I admit JBT's are a delicious. Any health benefits from TVP and deep frying is for others to answer. Feel free to google TVP. What it is..How it's made. . TVP retail isn't exactly cheap because it's marketed by the health food industry. While the fast food industry uses it for cheap filler. In summary, although Jack in Box tacos are great, I won't be using TVP filler in my tacos.

It has actually been a lot of fun check to see how this developed. My batch included apples, pears, blueberries, strawberries, dried plums, dried apricots and maybe one other thing I forgot. I used an assortment of dark rums including Bacardi, Myers Spiced Rum, and Appleton Dark. After week 2, yes I checked, the fruit still had all its flavor and a nice kick of rum to boot.  Started having visions of myself getting soused eating fortified fruit salad. By week 4, the fruit was beginning to lose flavor and color.  And my dried fruits were looking quite swollen.  The rum was taking on a reddish hue as well. Hmmm. Week seven is here. Fruit is grey and unappealing - no more visions of fruit salad.  But the beverage, this is a drink afterall, is rich and syrupy and has all this wonderful flavor that while strong is quite smooth.  It tastes more potent than my original rum - so I'm guess a little addition fermentation took place. The color has also deepend to a lovely reddish amber. Now I wish my batch had been bigger to give as a holiday gift.  Thanks! 2006 Update:  Made this again starting my crock in March for Christmas.  Yes that's  nine months.  Put it away and just left it alone.  Amazing stuff.  Packed up up with some stollen and it was the perfect gift for a German friend.  The biggest challenge was we all fought over the 80 proof fruit which ufter being yucky became wonderful all over again.  For eating purposes, the fall fruits and dried fruits worked best.

I started my Rumtopf about 6 weeks ago; so far I have added strawberries, raspberries, peaches, apricots, plums, fresh figs and mirabelles. I plan to enjoy it fairly soon - but I have peeped inside already! It is as it should be, a wonderful dark russet colour, with all the fruit being glossy and perfectly preserved. I used amber rum and brown sugar, as I prefer the flavour of brown sugar in Rumtopf. I made this for Christmas and New year 2007/2008 - but I suspect we will have broken into this a long time before then! Thanks for this recipe Thorsten!

This went together pretty easily. The directions are a little confusing but I think I got it right. Mixed the fruit and sugar and let it set for 1 hour. Stirred and added the rum. It says to make sure the fruit is covered so I added more rum to keep it covered. About 1 1/2 cups I think. Some of the fruit was floating though. Hope that is ok.

I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 cup brown sugar. I increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp and the ginger and nutmeg to 1 tsp each (but still could have used more spice). Finally, I used low-fat evaporated milk. Doubling the recipe was a mistake, and it ended up filling a 10 inch deep-dish pie crust (Recipe #131830) and made a crustless pumpkin pie in a greased 9 inch pie plate. Also, the taste was good, but the texture was too light, almost whipped. Most pumpkin pie recipes of a similar size call for 3/4 cup evaporated milk, not 1 1/2 cups. I like my pie firm, so I'd use 3/4 cup next time. I baked the deep-dish pie for 10 minutes at 450F, and put in the crustless pie after decreasing temp to 350F. Both then baked for about 50 minutes.

They are more like shortcakes, shortbreads, British biscuits or American cookies........slightly soft in the centre and crispy on the outside. The dough is easy to make and roll out - I used small sized scone cutters to cut mine out. There was no salt in the recipe and I thought that might be why some reviews said they tasted doughy, so I added 1/4 teaspoon of low salt to enhance the flavour. I halved the recipe to make 10 biscuits and used 2 teaspoons of ground ginger and a pinch of cayenne pepper. They were subtle and quite spicy, not as spicy as I thought they might have been - I may add more ginger next time or use freshly grated ginger root. They took about 20 minutes to bake on the middle shelf at 180C. We enjoyed these with a cup of tea today. I am glad I tried these out - I suspect they may even need to be harder, more like a spicy rusk - pleasant biscuits that were not too sweet. Thanks for posting!
