First off: I have had my eye on this recipe for months...I think the baking in a coffee can drew me towards it because that's what my Nana used to bake her brown bread in.  I was also attracted to the mixes of flours (quite the bouquet here!!)  This recipe is divine...the bread is incredible.  To date this is my favorite discovery on ZAAR.  I used my normal coffee cans and followed the instructions with no deviations (very unusual for me) - my cans were slightly off sized (11.5- I think), but close enough and I knew I could work around the fact that they had a little lip to the top part of the can ...I filled them 3/4 full and they rose and bloomed into sort of muffin topped rounds when baked for the exact 1.5 hour.  After some cooling time (when I could handle the cans) I cut the top portion off (the little muffin shaped top part - YUM), turned the cans lip end down and used a can opener to cut the bottom open. The rounds then fell out from the opened lip-less end.  They were perfectly shaped with the lovely fluting from the can molds.  The presentation is wonderful and the flavor is even better. The loaf rounds are moist with a fabulous texture (all of those fantastic flours)...btw, the crispy muffin tops were delicious too - I saved those all for myself while giving 2 loaves away and allowing my husband to devour the third.  As far as my flours, my all- purpose was not organic, but I was able to splurge with the rest.  I used raisins but am absolutely dying to get my hands on good dried blueberries and make this again to give to my Mom when she visits me next month (I can't wait :) - better get to drinking my coffee to get more cans prepped )  I think  she will be thrilled with this taste of her childhood.

The only changes I made were to replace 1/3 of the flour with wheat flour, added a little extra rum (1 teaspoon to a double batch) because the dough seemed to dry to hold together (I used Captain Morgan Spiced Rum by the way) and had to bake a little longer than listed, but I think that was because of the high altitude.

complicated but it's really not.  most of the time the dough is either resting or rising.  for this recipe you'll need a pastry brush and something that will allow you to evenly distribute flour over

not work with margarine.  you'll end up with a big mess in your oven if you use margarine.   also, in step #11 where it says to thoroughly flour your work surface, you need to resist the temptation to knead any more flour into the dough.  the dough is suppose to be that wet.  \\nnote: if you wish to measure the flour by weight rather than by volume, 3 1/4 cups flour is approximately equal to 14.33

Next time, I think I will substitute milk (since I'm not dairy restricted), or perhaps unsweetened applesauce, for at least half of the molasses-in fact, probably for all of it. I think the other flavors will have more of a chance then. Also, I did make very large cookies (about 3 1/2 across), but I only got 18 of them.

I made these at our cabin (which has no electricity or running water). I used bottled water and had to use a grill with a cast iron skillet to make them. Mine turned out more like little pancakes than crepes (I did individual pancake portions, rather than making large ones and then slicing). I did double the recipe to feed us all. I was told that the 6 ounces (weight) of the flour was equal to 1 1/2 cups.... minus  pinch (volume). I did have to use approx 12 ounces of chicken stock per each batch to get it to thin a bit. Everyone seemed to like them, but they probably would be nicer in &quot;crepe&quot; form. I served them with sour cream, which was nice. Believe it or not... hubby would not let anyone touch the food until HE took a photo (I have yet to get it from his camera, but I will post it). Everyone razzed him about it, but he explained that he is getting used to the pics before eating! LOL. This served up well with a pork loin on the rotisserie, grilled asparagus and apple sauce. I can&#039;t wait to try this again under controlled circumstances (in my own kitchen). Thanks for posting.

It seemed to me while mixing the ingredients that the batter was VERY thin and that the amount of flour required was too little... surely the 1/2 c. is just a typo.  I did use 1 cup instead of the 1/2 c. as stated, and even with the additional 1/2 c. the bread was still almost dough after fully cooking + another 10 minutes!  After finally looking around at other Amish Friendship Starter bread recipes, I noticed that most require 2 cups of flour.  I would recommend to anyone trying out this recipe that you use at least 2 cups of flour also.  The flavor of this recipe is yummy, but it needs more flour.  Hope this helps.

I made a couple of changes to make this compatible with the WW Core program.

Miller has a good recipe #14556 if folks are interested.  Also, I used 3 ounces of reduced fat extra sharp cheddar and suplemented it with an ounce of soy mozzarella.
