You made our day with this recipe! I made this this afternoon for a girl named Abi who turned seven today as a gift cake for her birthday! I have to tell you what I did.. I was really short on time. Here's what I did...I beat an egg in a bowl until it was light and fluffy and then added 3 tbsps. water and continued to beat it till it was really light and fluffy. Thereafter, I added in the sugar and creamed it well. Then, added in the cocoa powder(I used Hintz Dutch Processed Cocoa powder), flour and margarine(as a substitute for butter). Last of all, I added in the vanilla essence and mixed everything well. The batter was very stiff. I had an idea at this stage. I added in 3 cups of vanilla ice cream(softened) into the batter and mixed it in real nicely..wowww, the beautiful brown colour that emerged was really awesome! Then, I poured this mixture into a greased cake tin and baked it in my AMC Dutch Oven for 1 hour 30 minutes. I must tell you that my house smelt like a gourmet bakery particularly in the last 15 minutes while this cake was baking. (On the stove was this cake being baked and in my oven were Apple muffins(by chef Dayla)!\\nMy house smelt mmmmmmmmmmmmmm :)\\nSo I say, it wouldn't be wrong to call this 'potpourri cake' for the lovely smell of this cake during the last few minutes of its baking. LOL. I had quite a shocking surprise when I opened the lid of the AMC Dutch oven. I saw that the huge quantity of cake had shrunk to quarter its size(I have no idea what happened) and in the process, the steam of the lid condensed upon my left thumb leaving it red and burnt. That's ok, Burnol did the trick, I'm fine:) Once the cake was ready(the toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake came out with a few crumbs clinging to it), I removed it onto a plate and poured 2 cups of softened and partially melted vanilla ice-cream over the cake and let it run down the sides of the cake. MMMMMMM:)\\nM for mmmm and M also for messy. LOL. But Y for yummy! Whatever I'd made tasted yummy(okie, confession- I tasted a few crumbs from the cake tin that remained in it while it was removed with some ice-cream). Then, after this, I put the cake into my freezer and let it sit there for 2 hours before I packed it up in clingfilm wrap and aluminium foil and sent it off to the girl whose birthday it was today. At 10:10pm, I got a phone call from her saying that she was very happy on me and I have made her day with the cake and muffins. Oh and to get her all excited, I named this cake Chocolate Snowball Cake. She was soooo excited on the phone, you had to hear the happiness in her voice, O My!:) You can bet I'll have to make this for the 30th(the day she's celebrating her birthday and I'm not allowed to enter her house without cake and muffins and dessert).

They baked (on a greased sheet) and only stuck very slightly...grease your pan good.  They bake however you want them to.  Less time+thicker cut= softer cookie.  Time as stated in recipe + 1/8 inch cut = softer when warm, crispier when dried.  The edges were better when they got a little color on them.

I do prefer softer, sweeter cookies and these bake harder and are not that sweet.  Only problem was that the dough turned crumbly after mixing, even though I followed directions and softened the butter before use. To solve, I added a few drops of water at a time to the crumbly dough, until it was smooth and pliable. A tip I read: use confectioner sugar instead of flour to roll out dough. That really helped add more sweetness! I'm giving a 4 due to not needing to refrigerate prior to use, recipe ease, and fact that dough held the cookie cutter shapes.

We made several different sizes from 1&quot; to 2&quot; and found we needed different baking times based on size and thickness - 6 minutes for the smaller/thinner ones, and 7 minutes for the bigger/thicker ones. Time cooling also seemed to affect whether or not they held together...we had some angel wings and heads break off trying to get them off the pan :(  Overall, this was a simple and flavorful recipe - we used powdered sugar to roll out, and the dough was the perfect consistency. We did chill it for about 15 minutes before rolliing them out, but after that we used the dough at room temperature with no problems.

It wasn&#039;t what I expected it to be. Usually I use cut out recipes that require sitting in the fridge for 2 hours. I did not have time for this, so I whipped these up.

It was not ideal to work with, but the taste of the dough was incredibly delicious. Before and after baking. Most of my other sugar cookie recipes taste like chalk. This was so yummy! If you can, take a little time to work with the dough, use floured utensils to cut and transfer the cutouts onto your baking sheet, and don&#039;t take them off the tray until they are done cooling.

Sweetened condensed milk cannot be found here, even in high-priced import stores. To satisfy my DHs pleas for key lime pie, I opted for a clone & found your recipe. As it was basically a test effort, I chose to make just the pie filling in ramekins. The prep was so easy, but worrisome as the only dry milk available was full-fat, not skim. My mixture was *very* thick (like a frosting). I added 2 tbsp boiling water to the mixture, went full speed ahead & prayed. I can happily report it worked like a charm, the filling was the perfect consistency to be cut like a pie & my DH will be a happy camper tonite.
