I made these using white rice flour instead of the corn flour and 10 oz. of water instead of 12 oz. They turned out pretty good, but like other posters have said, they are a bit eggy - and I'm not sure they make a great tortilla so much as more of a crepe. My kids and I agreed that if they were a bit thicker they would make a good gluten free pancake! Having said all that, when I set out to make these I wasn't looking for a tortilla or a crepe/pancake, I was looking for something I could use as a pizza crust, becasue I didn't have any xanthan or guar gum. So, I made one of these a bit thicker than the others and then topped it with barbeque sauce on one half, and thai almond sauce on the other half. Then, I added my toppings and baked it for about 15-20 min. at 425. It actually turned out pretty good! The bottom was a bit soggy, but I think I could rememdy that by putting it on a baking stone next time (instead of a metal pan). In the end, I guess I am happy to have gotten some semblence of pizza! But, I'm still not quite sure how to rate these!\\nUPDATE #1:   I tried again tonight with a thinner left over wrap from two nights before. I still couldn't get the wet texture of the wrap to leave my pan and jump onto my hot baking stone by the time I had all of the toppings on it. But, this time I only had the normal thinner wraps (instead of the thicker one I made specifically to make a pizza the first time), and baked it on a metal pan on the bottom rack in the oven and the outer 2/3 actually started to firm up and turn a bit crisp. I think I might be on to something....\\nUPDATE #2:  I made a half of the recipe again tonight, using 1/4 tsp. garlic granules, and only using about 4 oz. water (still using rice flour instead of corn flour). I ended up spreading the batter onto a hot pan so it was 1/8+ thick. I cooked it until it was golen brown on both sides. Then, I let it cool and topped it with pizza sauce and toppings, and picked it up, and put it onto a hot (450) pizza stone. I let it cook 10-15 min. and it turned out fairly crunchy around the outside, and fairly substantial in the middle. It still isn't your typical 'bread' crust, but if you like a thin crust, crispy pizza, this just might be for you!"},{"name":"low fat hazelnut cappuccino biscotti","steps":"sift the flour , sugar , baking soda , baking powder , cinnamon , nutmeg , and salt', 'in a separate bowl , mix the coffee , milk , egg , egg white , and vanilla', 'add to the dry ingredients and stir until doughy', 'fold in the hazelnuts', 'on a floured surface , form two logs 8 long and 3 wide', 'spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray and place the logs a few inches a part', 'if desired , prepare an egg wash of 3 / 4 part egg white and 1 / 4 part water', 'brush the logs gently and cover w / coarse sugar', 'bake for 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees until golden brown', 'cool for 15 minutes', 'cut the logs into', '5 thick slices and place cut side up on the cookie sheet', 'cook for an additional 40 minutes at 275 degrees flipping halfway through'","description":"this recipe is inspired by a similar version of a recipe from julie van rosendaal's one smart cookie.  perfect with a cup of coffee.  be certain that you like hazelnuts before preparing this recipe; the nutty flavor is distinct!!  if you want a stronger coffee flavor, use espresso, otherwise i recommend a strong dark blend","ingredients":"flour', 'sugar', 'baking soda', 'baking powder', 'cinnamon', 'ground nutmeg', 'salt', 'coffee', 'skim milk', 'egg', 'egg white', 'real vanilla', 'hazelnuts'","review":"This is a very nice salad!

After the water comes to a boil and you lid the pan and turn down the heat, you only want to see steam seeping from the lid, if there's a lot of steam, the heat's too high; turn it down. If you follow these simple directions, you'll be very pleased with the results.  As a side note, I have added various seasonings and/or sauces to the boiling water just prior to adding the rice (give it a quick stir) with great success.  Another nice variation is to replace the water with equal amounts of canned broth (chicken, beef, vegetable, etc.) lower sodium broth is preferable.  I seldom add the optional butter, it's not needed; neither is the salt; the decision is yours in regards to these additions, but don't alter the method, it's critical to a successful pot of rice.

I tried your recipe this morning, and it was great.  I was unsure about the mayo -- I'd never put it in biscuits before, but I followed the recipe anyway.  I realized halfway through that I was out of garlic, so I just used some garlic powder, and a little onion as an after thought as I remembered the comment about chives.  The batter was a little runny, so I restrained myself from adding too much extra flour when I remembered your advice about them being hard, even against my healthy paranoia.\\n\\nThey turned out great.  The garlic for me was a little understated, but I did have to substitute the powder.  Next time I'll use the real thing, or a little more.  They had a great, deep, almost tangy flavour that comes out a second or two after you bite into them unlike other biscuits I've mad.  I'll attribute that to the mayo, I think.\\n\\nThanks again for the recipe.

Did not have these in my meat bundle that I just purchased from the butcher, so I substituted a bone in pork roast. The versatality came when I found that even with the italian bottled sauce I used, I was still able to adapt the left overs to a mexican style dish the next night. An Italian friend of mine likes to use pork when she decides to flavor her homemade sauce with meat. She said there is something about pork that lends it self so well to tomatoe based sauces. I agree this was very flavorful and worked as the center of the entree with both the pasta the first night, and rice the second night with out tasting like left over meat. This is nice and hearty.

My point, it is NOT critical to cook your steaks in a pan to benefit from this delicious sauce. I reduced a full bottle of wine (I think it's important to use a good drinkable wine and reduce the whole darn thing!). Meanwhile.... I melted the butter & EVOO, sauteed the shallots, garlic and thyme and set aside until the wine was ready. Once the wine was reduced, I  added the flour to the butter & shallots and combined well. Then added the reduced wine mixture.  VERY tasty, a bit salty so next time I will pay more attention to the sodium content of my stocks.

It takes longer than 5 minutes to just gather ingredients. 4) Saut&eacute; onion/garlic until onion is translucent or is browned? While I was comfortable guessing since exact measurements aren't critical, this recipe could be tough for a newbie cook or one unfamiliar with this type of food. I doubled the cumin, used one can of garbanzos (a little less than called for so we wouldn't have 3/4 of an open can left), and next time will double the tomatoes.

I actually found this recipe by the same name on another site. Many reviews were submitted and was a smash hit. I learned from the reviews that 2 lbs of meat is simply too much for just 8 peppers. So I prepare this with just 1 lb of meat and I use mild Italian chicken sausage. I also cook the sausage first and try to get a few caramelized bits in there. As I cook the sausage I use a potato masher to try and declump the sausage. After it has cooked, I dump the sausage onto a plate covered with paper towel to soak up the olive oil and any fat before I prepare the sausage mixture.  Because I use only 1 lb of sausage I cut the ingredients for the sausage mixture in half, except for the egg. Speaking of the egg, this recipe doesn't state where/when to use the egg, but it's to act as the glue for the sausage mixture. With 1 lb of meat, I was able to make 7 stuffed peppers (super stuffed and of good size) with enough left over just to plug up (just at the opening) 3 peppers that I stuffed only with fresh mozzarella cheese. I've used both anaheim and cubanelle peppers. The first time I made this recipe I boiled the peppers as instructed and last night I didn't. Near the end of the baking time, I add mozzarella on top and take the dish out after it has melted. I put crushed red peppers on the table for those who would like to add a bit more heat to their dish.
