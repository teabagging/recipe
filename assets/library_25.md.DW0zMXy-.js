I used two packages of Knox gelatin in the cranberry also I wanted them stiff.  IMPORTANT NOTE add the Knox gelatin when the mixture is still cold or room temperature this prevents the little chewy clumps also the nuts float if you add them right away soft set first then add nuts.  The apricot was not as sweet as the cranberry probably because cranberry jelly is loaded with sugar.  But the apricot was sweet enough for us. I grew up in Washington and they resemble cotlets.

I have left over pastry. Not have a baking temp, or directions for baking without a filling was a little disconcerting, as I didn't have time to mess it up. I baked them blind at 375 degress for 12 minutes, then baked an additional 7 minutes, each tart shell needed a from there they each need 1 or 2 minutes more so I kept a close eye until they were just right.

I am picky about my sloppy joe sauce because the sauce is really the show of the meal...right?  Anyway, I made this because a previous review or two described it as light and refreshing with the O.J. I did not start with a fresh orange but used orange juice not from concentrate thinking that would be close enough.  Otherwise followed exactly. I thought I would have too much liquid in the end if I covered the brew, so I simmered without my lid.  After 20 minutes the consistency was perfect and we had sloppy joes on bread (but we like it on hot dog buns when we want to pick it up and eat it...less messthan hamburger buns).  Now, this is a compliment, remember...this tasted just like Heinz with a hint of orange and now when I run out of my fav I will make this from the ingredients I usually have in my pantry and satisfy that mighty sloppy-joe craving!  Here's a funny...I could not find my soy sauce anywhere and I was panicked because I had everything else already in the pot cooking so I remembered the leftover chinese takeout packets of soy sauce that I always have around in my pantry...just so you know 2 TB is almost exactly 2 1/2 packets of soy sauce! ;-).  I did expect something unusual and extra-ordinary but it missed the mark a little for the different catagory...that's why I'm rating it 4 instead of 5 stars.

Cooked on high for about 1/2 hour and on low for for about 3 hours.Now since this was made to go in the freezer, the noodles aren't going to be cooked until later.( after I cook the noodles, I'll post a photo ) But, I did taste it and thought it was very good.

I veganized it by using Vegan Gourmet brand cheddar substitute.  It worked out nicely.  I put it under the broiler for a minute after baking to get it to melt.  I also used salsa instead of tomato sauce, as suggested by some of the reviewers.  I did not find the carrots and onions to be too crunchy.  I grated the carrots and minced the onion finely, so maybe that's why.  Like Rita, I used a whole can of beans and extra chips.  It did not say what size pan to use, so I used my 13 x 9 Pyrex baking dish.  It was enough to feed my husband and I for 3 days.  The leftovers were good: not to soggy or anything.

I have to admit that I didn't really stick to the measurements given, but the combination of ingredients was wonderful.  I used 1/4 of a large onion, 1 medium carrot (about 45g), 160g frozen corn, and a combination of green enchilada sauce and mild salsa, the cheese I didn't measure, but just covered generously with grated cheese.  The other ingredients I did measure and added as per the recipe.  I needed to cook this for 40 minutes to heat the middle through, and brown the cheese on top.  The texture was wonderful- partially crisp and crunchy, partially soft and filling.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I hardly noticed that there was no meat.  Very satisfying, just as written.  I did add a dollop of sour cream to serve.  I'd say that this is 4 servings as written.

This was delicious! 48 pieces of wrapped love, 1 for you, 47 for me...hehehehe. These have just the right tartness and flavor of great Middle Eastern food. I want more! When I went to buy the grape leaves (calls for 1 jar), I saw 3 sizes available: Might be the right size, Looks like it could be a mistake, and Definitely feeds King Kong. I picked the 1 pound jar which worked out great (and as it turns out, has about 50 leaves in it). I didn't have any citric acid, and thought about using lemon juice, but remembered seeing some at a brewing supply place that sold wine-making supplies, so I waited till I got that. It was very inexpensive- less than 1 dollar for a bottle (people might check the phone book for home-brewing supplies). There also wasn't a 100 gram can of tomato paste available; seems the 8 ounce (170 gram) is the smallest you can get. I used half in stirring into the rice mix. When it came time to mix the 1/2 tbsp. into the water, I just added the rest of the can (why waste the rest?), and what I did was stir it into some water and pour it over instead of seeing some lump sit there in the pot. The taste was wonderful. This seems perfect to go with kebabs. Next time I make those kebabs I will have some of these to go with.

I made mine fatter than cigars, lined the bottom of the pot with peeled cut fresh carrots because we like them with dolmas, mixed the instruction #9 before pouring it over everything, I also didn't cook for so long and there was some liquid left which I drained off before pouring them out onto a platter. We enjoyed them with yogurt mixed with freshly squeezed lemon juice and some sea salt. The only thing I noticed was that by the end of dinner (this was had as a whole meal, hot) the dolmas began to get dry. I don't know why other than maybe citric acid can do that.

When I make toast cups I brush them with melted butter on both sides before toasting them and fill them with scrambled eggs, bacon bits, and cheese for breakfast; or with creamed salmon or tuna and peas; or fried mushrooms and onions with odd bits of leftovers (potatoes, meat, veggies)using leftover gravy or cream of mushroom soup (or other cream of soup). I have some frozen pastry tart shells in the freezer and I think this filling would great in those too.

I asked my children what they wanted for dinner, and the 11 year old requested garlic noodles - who knows where she got that from.  Anyway, I found several recipes online, and decided to try this one. Well, actually, my Google search brought up a very similar recipe that was added in November 2013.  Since this one was added in March 2010, I assume the other chef amended this one slightly to make it their own.  So, it was easy to make for sure - I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I really like the Cantonese sauce, and will use it in other applications. The instructions for the sauce preparation probably could have been a bit more clear, such as &quot;whisk together ...&quot;, but it was easy to make.  I added less salt because there was quite a bit of sodium already in the recipe.  I don&#039;t think it had a lot of garlic flavor (I used more than 3 teaspoons), in fact, I added some garlic powder once I put everything in the wok and tasted the sauce.  The red pepper flakes totally overpowered the garlic flavor and the delicate noodles (I used a fresh egg noodle from my international market).  I added some shrimp on top just before serving.  It&#039;s very tasty, for sure, but I think I may actually try PFs just so I can make a true comparison."},{"name":"pink snowflake","steps":"pour grapefruit juice into champagne flute', 'slowly pour sparkling wine', 'slip into something silky and listen to some jazz !'","description":"better than a mimosa!\\nvery elegant.","ingredients":"pink grapefruit juice', 'sparkling wine'","review":"Something went wrong here.

Great taste -- loved the 2 layers of lemon juice and all that roasted garlic, but instructions and timing required adjustments.   At 35 minutes, my thighs weren't close to done -- could be the fault of U.S. super-sized thighs, dunno.  Based on the easy pull away from the bone criterion, I cooked up to 50 minutes in the oven before transferring to the grill. By the time they charred, that didn't leave enough time to prepare the sauce for basting before the thighs were ready to leave the grill. Because I am slower than average, it would be best for me to prepare the glaze prior to the charring.  With one clean swipe of the roasted garlic by my Chinese chopping knife, it was a cinch to squeeze the garlic from the lemon.
