But first, as a note to those of you using chicken breast: place the meat in a plastic baggy and pound the meat into a more uniform width.  This will make cooking moist chicken far easier!  I only had chicken tenders on hand. I salted and peppered and marinated them in Dijon mustard for a half hour while I got the onions, garlic, and beans ready.  I cooked according to the recipe, browning the meat on both sides before throwing in the onion, and then roughly 2 minutes later, the garlic.  I also poured in a healthy dollop of white wine (between 1/4 and 1/2 cup) and set it to simmer while I cooked up my noodles.  I added the green beans, added a bit of garlic salt on top of them, and let the entire thing cook down for roughly 20 minutes.  I added 3T of 2% milk at the end, removed everything but the sauce, and let it reduce while I finished the noodles.  Cooked like this, the chicken came out moist, tender, and super flavorful.  In the future, I may cook the green beans only on top of the chicken, as they absorbed the mustard flavor more readily than the meat. Next time I will squeegee more of the mustard off before tossing it into the skillet!  I served it on top of Rotini pasta.  If I do this again, I will serve it on white rice instead.'"},{"name":"Buffalo Chicken Sliders","rate":"4.1960783","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/710219.jpg","ingredients":"rotisserie chicken celery chopped carrots crumbled blue cheese Buffalo wing sauce dinner rolls split","cooking":" Prep 25 m Cook 20 m Ready In 45 m Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

I have to wonder if a flank steak, whether bison or beef, is the best cut of meat for this recipe, particularly since bison is so incredibly lean.  The recipe says to cook for 35-40 minutes, but has no cooking temperature indicated.  I looked up stuffed beef tenderloin on this site, and all recipes said to cook at  425 degrees F, so that\\\\u2019s what I did.  Took the meat out at 25 minutes, and it was just slightly pink, overcooked for us contributing to the chewiness.  Probably 5 minutes less would have been better as far as doneness goes.  The flavor of the bison was sweet and the filling was good, but unfortunately, the meat itself was tough.  From an eye appeal point of view, I also think it would have benefitted from slightly browning the meat on the stovetop before going into the oven, as visually, it did not develop a nice browned crust.

I did not have red currant jelly so I used a cup of homemade green grape jelly. Also did not have chili ketchup, so I used reg ketchup and spiced it up with a 1/4 cup homemade Thai sweet chili sauce with added 1/4 cup small frozen berries w/pomegranate in the pot ,but I omitted the water and the flakes since the Thai sweet chili sauce was spicy already.Added one finely diced red pepper for extra flavour. Also fried up the sausages like one of the reviewers said and it turned out fantastic. No leftovers and so glad I tried this with our roast dinner. The sweet sauce was great on the roast beef and on the mashed carrot/potatoes too.'"},{"name":"Fruit Glazed Pork Roast","rate":"4.199999809","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/720x405/1004333.jpg","ingredients":"fluid ounce) can soy sauce cider vinegar fresh ginger root ground ginger packed brown sugar pork roast","cooking":" To Marinate: In a large resealable plastic bag combine the fruit nectar, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger root, ground ginger and brown sugar.
