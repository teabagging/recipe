I broiled the ham for the last 5 minutes in order to achieve a slightly crisp glaze on the outside (didn't have a butane torch :-P). The result was a nice moist, sweet (but not too sweet - just perfect!) ham with lots of leftovers.

We relocated from San Diego, Calif to Reno, Nevada a year ago so we no longer have a ham store from which to shop... and they don&#039;t mail deliver to my city so we made our own. And I&#039;m SO happy we did. It was one-quarter the cost... their 7-lb ham $88. My 10-lb ham, plus all ingredients, $21. We found the pear juice in the baby food aisle of the store (great tip!!). We doubled the brown sugar and honey mixture and basted/baked the glaze on in two separate steps so it would come out thicker. (Tip: put the glaze on the top end and as it oozes down the ham brush it into the spiral cuts.) Then I had my hubby torch the glaze to a crackle outside on the BBQ. Since moving to elevation (5,000 ft), I&#039;ve had to modify every roast recipe so it doesn&#039;t come out overcooked. We modified this recipe&#039;s oven temp to 350 degrees and cooked the ham til the internal temp read 120 degrees on the thermometer, then added the glaze in steps and cooked it til the internal temp was the 140 degrees specified in the recipe. It was delicious! The grazing began from the moment we cut the ham apart. It was the STAR of our Christmas dinner.

Cheese went on top and then a quick zap in the micro got it melty - used more cheese. My poaching technique leaves a lot to be desired, so I beat the egg and poured it in a ribbon into the broth - as for egg drop soup. I did find I desired both more salt and pepper than called for. It's a delicate soup - perhaps a bit too delicate for me. I'm more a big and bold rather than delicate.
