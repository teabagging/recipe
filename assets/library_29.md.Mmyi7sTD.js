I signed up for this website just so I can comment on this recipe. Not going to lie, I was hesitant about using a recipe that consists a half a cup of dijon mustard, but I am SO glad I took a chance. The taste is not overpowering at all, yet enhances as you grill the chicken. I didn&#039;t change one thing to the recipe as far as ingredients and neither should you. The cook time was longer as many people have mentioned, I did about 20 minutes on each side so 40 mins total. I was lazy and kept the the whole wing intact, but it still came very juicy and full of flavor.  I marinated the wings for four hours. I think anymore than that, it may have been a little too salty because of the soy sauce so this is a great day of BBQ recipe. Crowd pleaser for sure!!

Voila! Perfect poached aggs in about five minutes! If someone wants something Mexican that's not loaded with Taco Seasoning, this is definitely it. We'll be impressing our visitors with this breakfast/brunch/supper entree in the very near future. I might also make two batches next time.... one with kidney beans (as listed) and one with canned chili hot beans, including the sauce. I think so jalapena cheese (shredded) would be nice too.

I've never had any cookies from Dancing Deer Bakery, but the pictures have always looked delicious.  I'm not giving this a star rating because it did not work out for me, but I did want to pass on a couple of observations based on my experience.  In the beginning, I tried cutting them into shapes with cutters as specified in the recipe; however, I gave up on that after the first couple of batches because it is somewhat difficult to get the dough rolled to a uniform thickness (due to the add-ins) and secondly because when you bake them, the toffee melts and oozes out of the shapes anyway so it didn't look very pretty.  I switched to rolling them into balls and shaping into flat discs and that seemed to be much less stressful as well as worked better for baking purposes.  I ended up baking both versions (cut into shapes and discs) for closer to 13 minutes and that actually still seemed too long for my oven because quite a few came out burnt-tasting (but visually looked fine because of the dark color of the chocolate so it was hard to tell until you bit into one).  The dough is not hard to work with and does not seem dry, but the finished cookies seemed kind of dry - perhaps it was the very chocolatey taste that really makes you thirsty.  Overall, I will not make again, but I do want to thank you swissms for posting so that I had the opportunity to try them.

I used a combo of 1 cup greenpeas, a small cauliflower(cut into florets) and 2 tins of mushrooms(drained) and chopped into halves. I used mushrooms mainly because my mom was in a despo mood to have mushrooms for dinner tonight. She was actually craving for a mushroom-peas curry. I followed Momma Mirj and used 3 cloves of garlic. I did cut down on the oil by 1 tbsp..(I used 2 tbsps. only instead of 3). I did substitute the paprika with black pepper. For the stock, I immersed 2 cubes of Maggi vegetable stock with onions in 1 1/4 cups of water, boiled it until the cubes were totally dissolved in the broth and used it as required in the recipe. I did use a total of 1 tsp. and a little over half a tsp. of salt. Using freshly ground spices imparts so much more flavour to the dish, so that is something I'd like to mention that I used all freshly ground spices. You are so right when you say this is nicely spiced. Its just great as it is! I loved the red colour of the curry and its aroma while it was cooking. This goes so well with hot Basmati rice. Made for a great meal for us and we did need one so much since we are going through a tough hour at the moment with my Grandmom's health being so low since a few days...\\nThe bottom line is that this made a great vegetarian dish and a wonderful dinner!

I though that the wateriness made the spices taste a little milder than they truly would.  All-in-all it turned out well though, a very pretty dish with golden cauliflower in an orange sauce sparked with bright red tomatoes.  I got really, really confused at step three where it says puree- you see, I read this as a verb, not as a noun, as it should be (refering to the tomato puree called for in the recipe) and I sat at the table for quite a few minutes trying to figure out why in the world I would puree this and how the next step (cook til tender) would make sense if this were pureed.

I have been making this for years, a GREAT recipe! Even tho this recipe is great as is, here are some of the changes I have made over the years: \\nI only use 1 cup of onions and I usually prepare the day before, refrigerate overnite, then reheat. \\nI also use only 1/3 tsp. cayenne. For me, it's easier to use two pkgs. of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry.  I have found that 1T. of lemon juice and 1 T. of Dijon mustard are a nice addition.  You can use half and half and the consistency is just as good.  Sometimes I add some minced water chestnuts to add some crunch.  If you are decadent like we are, add more cheese and a bit more sour cream.

I was gladly mistaken!

They were so surprised when I hollered from the kitchen &quot;Hey...it&#039;s GOOD!&quot;  This reminded me a lot of split pea soup, but it is SO much easier.  I usually make a crock pot version which takes a lot more prep and cook time and has a lot of ingredients, so I was excited that this reminded me of it so much.  I had my dad try some (he&#039;s my split pea soup buddy, my mom won&#039;t touch the stuff) and he said he wished the texture was smoother (which a little more blending could have fix) but he liked the taste.  Bottom line: if you like split pea soup you&#039;ll like this, and if you&#039;re like my mom, just make it for the pea soup lovers in your family. :)"},{"name":"potato salad with apples","steps":"cut up the potatoes and boil them', when they've got about five minutes left , stick the eggs in the pot as well, 'they should be hard-boiled', 'mix the mustard with the mayo and set it aside', 'when the potatoes and eggs are done , mash five of the potatoes and add the mayo mixture', 'cut the other three potatoes into small pieces and add as well', 'remove boiled eggs from shells and cut into slices', 'add to salad', 'chop the celery and apple into bite-sized pieces and add , with peas , to salad', 'stir it all together , sprinkle paprika on top , and enjoy !'","description":"this is my mom's recipe for potato salad. the apples give it an interesting flavour and texture.","ingredients":"potatoes', 'apple', 'canned peas', 'celery', 'eggs', 'mayonnaise', 'mustard', 'paprika'","review":"VERY good.

Between the original ingredients list and the tips in Step 4, it was very confusing.  Fortunately I had all necessary ingredients on hand because I rely on the Food.com Shopping List.  I used 2 tablespoons flour, 1 Tbsp. cornstarch, the sugars, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 dash freshly grated nutmeg, 1 pinch ground allspice, 1 pinch ground cloves and 1 Tbsp. vanilla.  I beat 1 egg white to glaze the bottom crust and baked that 2 minutes before loading filling.  My 8 Granny Smith apples weighed 4.32 lbs, and seemed 2 stories high stacked in the pie plate, although by serving time they settled into a plump mound above the top of the pie plate. (Eight medium Granny Smith apples would weight 3 lbs according the the USDA nutrient database.)  My lattice top crust perched atop the apple pile, and I could not crimp edges.  I gave up on brushing milk on the top crust.  The lattice design was lost by the time the pie emerged from the oven.  My guests LOVED the sauce on the top crust.  Although the pie had cooled completely prior to serving, the sauce did not congeal, but stayed a (delicious) gooey liquid.  Although I baked the pie for more than the maximum time, my guests said the apples were slightly undercooked.  My guests said there was no need to sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the crust.  I liked that this apple pie was definitely an APPLE PIE in which the apples dominated the sauce.  I used a Wegman&#039;s double-pie crust, and was very pleased with it; my guests suggested making a focaccia with the crust topped by the sauce.  I am not used to baking, but I will make this pie again, as our group can&#039;t get enough apple pie. As for the recipe and its many tips, I recommend creating a separate recipe for &quot;Apple Pie GRPA #2&quot; and for &quot;Apple Pie GRPA #3&quot;.
