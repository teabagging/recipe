I had this for dinner this week and it was a nice meal.  The chipotle  and all the black  pepper was a little too spicy for me... I didnt add the second dose of the chipotle either. The filling was a nice idea nut it didnt seem to pick up much flavor from the  bouillon..I would recommend some salt to the filling and a little queso .. would make it a little easier to cut if the filling stuck together a bit more.  This is a nice recipe and just needs a few tweaks for me  I had the leftovers with some avocado and greek yogurt...

Other people in my family who are spicy challenged want me to make them with sweet peppers and sweet sausage.  This was a great appetizer for a bbq Using laytex gloves was a good tip.  I also suggest refrigerating the sausage mixture to firm it up.  The firmer mixture makes it easier to stuff the peppers. Every family function, these are expected to be made.  Last time I made them; instead of adding bacon bits- I wrapped the stuffed peppers with a slice of bacon.  Hold it together with a toothpick.  This added 20 more minutes to the bake time.
