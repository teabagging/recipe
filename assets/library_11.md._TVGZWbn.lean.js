Also instead of splenda I used white sugar in a bit higher amount as I understand splenda is sweeter(?) I used canola oil as I did not have extra light olive oil and a little of a different juice as I did not have apple juice on hand. I used vanilla paste for the vanilla to be alcohol free. For the dried fruit/nuts/seeds I chose really sweet dried dates and walnuts in a 2 cup amount. I did use all the rest of the ingredients as listed.

I even went out and bought new baking soda, baking powder and salt thinking that might be my problem.  The chocolate is fantastic and I will use that recipe over and over again but if anyone has suggestions as to how to bake the vanilla better, I would love to hear it.

I only had light cream cheese and regular bread crumbs, so I made this recipe with those slight ingredient changes.  Perhaps because I didn't have fresh bread crumbs, my crust needed an extra tablespoon of melted butter, and didn't hold together well when I removed the cakes from the tins.  However, I just sprinkled the crust left in the tins over the cakes.  The taste and texture were just delicious, and they looked as good as they tasted.  I served them with a bunch of seedless red grapes, and four of us just devoured them as an appetizer.  I LOVE this, and will make again.  When I do, I'll really start tinkering, and maybe use olive oil in the bread crumb/walnut mix instead of butter, maybe even adding some garlic powder to it.  I used plain goat cheese this time, but will probably try some of the herbed or peppered cheeses next time.

It was spicy but actually not quite as hot as what we were going for, probably due to the brand of chili paste. So next time (and there will be a next time!) we make it we'll probably add some extra chili powder or try a different chili paste. It was fabulous with homemade roti.

I used all the listed vegetables and added a diced onion, four cloves of minced garlic and two sliced leeks. I kept the proportion of liquid the same - as I like my soups thicker rather than thinner - used all the stock specified, but  used only 1 cup of low-fat milk, and in place of the other two cups of milk, I used 1 cup of plain yogurt and 1 cup white wine. (I like to squeeze wine into soup recipes if I can find the space for it!) I also used only one tablespoon of melted butter and if I make this again - which is highly likely - I think I'll cut the butter back even more. Not that I don't love butter; just that I try not using it where I know we won't really miss it. Guided by the Zaar Kitchen Dictionary, I added some slivered almonds just before serving. Yummy!

I used spicy sausage, took it out of the casing and sauted it, adding the onions when it was almost done to blend the flavors.

For the milk and water, I followed the potato stovetop  package directions because they were different than the milk/water combo cited in the recipe. This brand used more milk than water, which I think made the meal creamier.  I figured every packaged potato mix is different, and the directions were 2 cups milk to 1 cup water for this brand of au gratin potatoes.  Since I used spicy sausage, I didn't add the cayenne.  I used frozen mixed veggies that I added in the last couple minutes of simmering.  Dh really liked it and I served it with my Garlic Bread With Cheese #90808.  I recco if you make this recipe to follow the package directions for the potatoes in terms of milk/water/butter measurements as each brand differs.  This is a real keeper!

After the broiling time, I poured the sauce of the wings, turning to coat evenly and then broiled for 2 more minutes.

Never tried  boiling first.  When I make wings I stopped using the butter/margarine in my sauce.  I use straight Louisiana sauce, to further reduce the fat.  You really don't need that butter.  Now I can enjoy the blue cheese more that way, without worrying about the calories from the butter.  If you have to use butter use WhoDat's recipe, it has enough butter to give the taste.  <br/><br/>Dang it, I gotta go to the store to get some wings, and have these for dinner now..:-)"},{"name":"old fashioned maple pancakes","steps":"sift dry ingredients together', 'stir wet ingredients together', 'combine all ingredients', 'heat and oil pan on medium-high heat', 'pour 1 / 4 cup of mixture at a time , repeat until you have used all of the ingredients'","description":"a nice cinnamon, maple twist on traditional pancakes, serve with fresh fruit, or cottage cheese","ingredients":"all-purpose flour', 'baking powder', 'salt', 'maple syrup', 'milk', 'olive oil', 'eggs', 'cinnamon', 'brown sugar'","review":"Really perfect seasoning.
