We like our crusts thin and this one worked great for that.  Dough was very easy to work with.  I divided the dough into three parts and made them &quot;rustic&quot; shaped.  I made the Margherita (with fresh mozarella) and made one with just olive oil, portabello slices, red onion slices (sauteed first) and chevre (goat cheese) and the third I topped with tomato sauce, herbs, salami, mushrooms, mozarella and grated Romano.  All three were delicious.

Made this for lunch this afternoon and my family and our friends enjoyed it to the last grain. Not a grain remained!! My picky eater bro. too said that this must be a regular on our table;) I did substitute the chicken stock with 'Maggi vegetable broth with onions' that I prepared by dissolving 2 cubes of the same in 4 cups of water and brought it to boil, then used as stated in the recipe. I did not have cilantro or parsley at home, unfortunately, so I used fresh corriander leaves and fresh celery instead. I used oregano(dried) for marjoram(as when I clicked on marjoram, Zaar said that it's actually oregano! I was thrilled to read that because I had oregano on hand). My house is smelling of garlic from one end to the other, and mmm, boy it smells incredible! I did not use any salt(as broth contains salt already) or pepper. This rice has to be served hot to be enjoyed best. I love the taste of the garlic and oregano the most in this. It is a meal on its own and a great one at that is what my family and our guests commented. A definite keeper!

It really is a great way to use up tomatoes, or get your tomato fix in. It is a bit labor intensive, particularly with the dough making, but the recipe does give fairly accurate prep/cook times. If you're in a hurry you could certainly use store-bought pie crusts. Also, I couldn't find sharp provolone anywhere (even at the gourmet meat market in my area) so I substituted half mild provolone and half sharp cheddar. Turned out great, if you like sharp cheddar of course. I will definately make this again with the following modifications: 1. use a shallow circular 12 tart dish because I think the home-made crust will work better. I used my pretty, deep, oval 12 pie dish and had to use every last crumb of dough to cover the sides - it was also hard to slice in a deep dish.  2. Use only 1.5 pints of grape tomatoes, or will try heirloom tomatoes sliced and layered on top - 2 pints of grape tomatoes was a bit too much for us and we love tomatoes,  3. Will bake higher up in the oven. I had the dish in the middle, and had to keep it in for an extra 5 minutes - even then all the tomatoes weren't cooked and soft.  The first time did come out quite well though, and my picky-eater of a b/friend said he'd eat it again.

Poaching seafood in stock/milk & then saucing it is also much-favored by Icelanders. This is an easy-fix & ingredient-friendly. I did have to use cod as I was unable to get haddock when we shopped, but it was otherwise made as written. This recipe is all about the sauce & it takes a bit more time to get the perfect consistency, but it is restaurant quality. All was well till the end when my DH hurried me & I erred by adding the parsley I had set aside directly into the sauce, so that eliminated straining it. IMO the yield is closer to 6 servings than 4 using 3 lbs of fillets w/the sauce, that would improve the nutritional data & there is plenty of sauce for 6 servings. I also feel a few tiny capers would work well as a final garnish.

Be extra careful when reducing the total number of servings for any recipe!<br/><br/>Anyway, I love pumpkin pie but can't make a decent crust to save my life and thought this recipe sounded like a very interesting substitute. Because of personal taste I added 1/2t salt and 2T molasses (or substitute dark brown sugar); using butter in the Bisquick clone instead of shortening or oil (1/2C flour, 1T powdered milk (optional), 1/2t salt, 1t baking powder, 1T butter); adding a little more spice including 1/4t clove, which I like in pie. I put a paper towel under the cooker lid to prevent water dripping into the pudding, <br/><br/>I've madethis several times and it's always a hit. Raves all around and many recipe requests.

Routinely, I add the fat and eggs called for and then add about two thirds of the milk and stir and see what the consistency is like. Some people like pancakes thicker than others.Takes practice. Also this is a very plain, basic recipe so if you like, experiment with adding a little fruit, spices, vanilla, ect. Also double check your baking powder because it loses its rising ability after a while. You can check online to see how to do this.

This is a great R-E-A-L-L-Y low-fat dish that is so wonderfully flavoursome that it wouldn't even occur to anyone that you served it to that it is, in fact, such a low-fat dish.  And isn't that what you want from a low-fat dish?  In view of what 2Bleu noted about the cooking time, I cut my sweet potato into much smaller pieces - basically into 1/2 inch slices.  But otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing, except perhaps - next time - sneaking in maybe a tablespoon of wine in place of a little of the pineapple juice. The cooking time was pretty right for the thinner slices.  Thank you for sharing this little gem of a recipe, TeresaS.

I loved the concept of placing the ingedients out all together but it just did not lend itself for what I needed today SOoooo I followed the recipe ingredients (with 1 variation) but made them a litt le differently. I brushed Olive Oil on one side of the bread slices and broiled the olive oil coated side of the bread I left the other side soft, Roasted the garlic as suggested, squeezed out the garlic and pureed it with the toasted pine nuts. 15 minutes before serving I spread a good 1/8 of the garlic/pine nut puree on the soft side of the bread added the goat cheese on top, However when I tasted the goat cheese with the garlic I decided that not everyone would like it so I did half with goat cheese and half with cheddar- then broiled them and served hot.  The cheddar broiled best and looked most attractive. Both goat cheese and the cheddar disappeared . I used a soft, herbed goat cheese. I liked the cheddar best.

REALLY GREAT!!!  This is the first pizza dough that I've worked with that actually was pizza quality and not super sticky and easily stretched.  I quadrupled the garlic to really give the full on garlic flavor.  I used kalamata olive oil (love the flavor of it!) cut back on the sugar a tad and followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  I did have to add more water during the dough cycle since it appeared too dry.  I then added a bit of flour when working with the dough at the end.  I did the double rise crust and it plumped up so nicely!  I will try adding a bit of italian seasoning to this next time to pump up the flavor of the crust as well.  We were VERY happy with this crust.  The best one we've made so far and we've tried many!
