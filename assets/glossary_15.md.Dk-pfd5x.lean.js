(Please feel free to confirm with Chris Kimball). With a few extra tips, this comfort food classic can be oh so delicious. Ground chuck has more flavor than ground round, and ground sirloin is even better. Whenever I make a stew, soup or any beef dish in which I want to impart a lot of beef flavor, I use sirloin. I also find the seasoning for the gravy to be lackluster. For savory gravy, try adding grated onion, chopped garlic, Worcestershire sauce, or a little beef consomme after sauteing the flour in the butter.. Another trick (that I learned from making meat sauce for spaghetti and loose meat sandwiches) is that the beef needs to simmer for almost 1/2 hour to get fully tender. To do this, after you brown your ground beef, add water about 1 1/2 cups of water to the pan for every pound of ground meat, bring it to the boil, then turn the heat to medium/low and let simmer for 25 mins. The water should have evaporated away, but the meat still moist.

They smell amazing!  I mixed these up with the help of my 2 and 4 year old.  I will most likely not rate these out of fairness, since I had to make a major substitution.  I have had to quit using butter due to a milk protein intolerance in my nursing infant.  I substituted coconut  oil for the butter, which I do in all types of recipes with fantastic results.  It does change the consistency of the final product though.  The melting point of coconut oil is 85 degrees, so when I mixed in the eggs (I should have known to wait for them to reach room temp) the batter seized up.  I am sure they will turn out delicious but more dense than normal.  I will update later when we eat them!

If you like apple pie, you'll love it. Everyone liked it at our Mother's Day dinner and I had a couple of requests for the recipe. As suggested, I served it with vanilla ice cream. I think it would have been even better if it was still warm and will try that next time. I doubled the recipe, using butter instead of margarine, 2 tsps of cinnamon, 2 Macintosh apples and pecans instead of walnuts. It took 35 minutes in a glass 9x13 pan. I think the instructions could use more explanation for newer cooks. I followed the patterns I've learned for similar recipes, creaming the butter and sugar with a hand mixer, then adding the eggs, then the dry ingredients with 1/2 of the floor, incorporating it well before adding the rest of the flour, finally stirring in the nuts and apples. The consistency is like a chocolate chip cookie dough (minus the choc chips) with apples mixed in. It's really easy to throw together and is a nice change from my other dessert recipes."},{"name":"baked elbow macaroni with italian sausage and peppers","steps":"cook the elbow macaroni according to package directions', 'preheat oven to 350 degrees f', 'heat olive oil in large skillet', 'add garlic , onion , peppers , and basil', 'saute 3 minutes , then add the sauce and sliced italian sausage', 'simmer 5 minutes', 'spread 1 cup of the sauce mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish', 'layer 1 / 2 of the macaroni , 1 / 2 of the sauce mixture , 1 cup mozzarella and 1 / 2 cup parmesan', 'repeat , and bake 25 minutes', 'let stand 10 minutes before serving'","description":"found this recipe on the box of whole wheat macaroni, and thought i would give it a try. very good.  i used fat free cheese and it tasted just as good as full fat. lower in fat, and loaded with fiber.","ingredients":"whole wheat macaroni', 'olive oil', 'garlic cloves', 'onion', 'green bell peppers', 'red bell peppers', 'basil', 'spaghetti sauce', 'italian sausage', 'mozzarella cheese', 'parmesan cheese'","review":"Very good..

I read the somewhat mixed reviews & made the recipe using med-sized (but sturdy) pasta shells & crisped the bacon as suggested by 2 reviewers. I do think black olives &/or grd meat would be excellent adds for those so inclined or when a greater amt is needed to serve family or guests. While I love the combo of flavours & see this as Mexican comfort food, I do feel the advantage of using a crockpot is lost on this recipe. I found myself wishing I could cook the pasta, assemble the ingredients in a casserole dish & pop it into the oven to get all bubbly B4 serving.

Yay! Yay!  My pudding worked!  For some reason, I've had the darndest time making baked rice pudding that actually turned out.  (Not normally an idiot in the kitchen.)  This is, I believe the fourth recipe I've tried in the last two years, and finally, it worked.  Wonderful rice pudding.\\n\\nI used aborio rice which I've discovered is the only rice that is going to make me happy in rice pudding. I don't like how long grain rice turns out.  I brought the mixture to simmer on top of the stove to cut cooking time and ended up baking for about an hour and a half.  The end result was *so* rich and thick (yay!), that I might try cutting the half and half with some whole milk next time.\\n\\nThanks!

I also used Toasted Sesame Oil as it has more flavor then regular sesame oil. I added a lot of fresh garlic. The directions in this recipe are spot on-many cooks tend to scramble their eggs rather then cooking them to a flat dry surface. Cooking them flat enables you to cut them in strips which is more authentic and looks nicer too. We enjoyed this recipe just thought it was a little bland for our palettes.

I layed 2 slices of the swiss cheese over each piece of chicken before baking, but the next time, I'm going to add it near the end of the baking time, so it won't brown too much.  Note: The brand of swiss cheese I used was, the Crystal Farms (it's kind of like the Kraft cheese slices).  The next time I'm going to try slices of smoked swiss cheese instead. Our Walmart store has some good smoked swiss cheese in their deli.  I think the cream of broccoli soup, and the cheddar cheese soup mixed together for this recipe, sounds good too.

The poster left off the garnishes, which add a whole dimension of texture and flavor to the soup, elevating it to a gastronomically interesting experience.  Since becoming a fan of Gordon Ramsay's cooking a few months, I've seen so many incomplete and mistaken reposts of his recipes... it's kind of bizarre!  I highly recommend getting his book, Healthy Appetite, and not relying on online reposts of his recipes.<br/><br/>What is missing from this recipe as posted is a mixture of nigella seeds (also misleadingly called onion seeds), and mustard seeds, both toasted until they start to pop and then added to the soup.  They add a cool new dimension of texture and flavor to the creamy texture and bouquet of the soup.  Also, you add yogurt (I use kefir) as a garnish, along with fresh cilantro.<br/><br/>Without the missing parts that I described, the recipe as posted is quite ordinary and uninteresting."}]`),G={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const t=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.name.toLowerCase().includes(t)||a.steps.toLowerCase().includes(t)||a.description.toLowerCase().includes(t)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},V={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},L={key:1};function R(a,t,o,c,s,r){const u=m("PoemCard");return i(),n("section",null,[t[3]||(t[3]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ recipe ü•≥")])],-1)),e("div",V,[t[2]||(t[2]=e("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),g(e("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":t[0]||(t[0]=l=>s.searchQuery=l),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,s.searchQuery]])]),e("div",Y,[(i(!0),n(f,null,w(r.filteredPoems,(l,p)=>(i(),k(u,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:t[1]||(t[1]=(...l)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...l))},[s.isLoading?(i(),n("span",L,"Loading...")):(i(),n("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):y("",!0)])}const P=d(G,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-0ac16a11"]]),_=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/15.md","filePath":"glossary/15.md"}'),F={name:"glossary/15.md"},Z=Object.assign(F,{setup(a){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{_ as __pageData,Z as default};
