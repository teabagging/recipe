I did a few things different though; used both hot and sweet sausage links, stewed tomatoes, and red onion. I cut up all veggies and added some butter, salt, and pepper placed all that in a tin foil pouch and put on the grill! I grilled the sausages separate. When finished, I cut them up and added them to the veggies,served over Penne pasta and topped with parm cheese!!  Even the kids loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!'"},{"name":"Beef Stew VI","rate":"4.596735954","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/720x405/729310.jpg","ingredients":"cubed beef stew meat vegetable oil beef bouillon water dried rosemary dried parsley ground black pepper large potatoes carrots celery large onion cornstarch cold water","cooking":" Prep 20 m Cook 2 h Ready In 2 h 20 m In a large pot or dutch oven, cook beef in oil over medium heat until brown.

Allow the mixture to cool. Pour the cooled vinegar mixture over the carrot, radish, and onion in a bowl, and allow to stand for at least 30 minutes. Drain off the excess vinegar mixture after the vegetables have marinated. While the vegetables are marinating, preheat the oven's broiler, and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan. Sprinkle the chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper, and broil on slotted broiler pan, turning once, until the center of the chicken breast is no longer pink and the surface has browned, about 6 minutes per side. Remove the broiled chicken, and slice into bite-size pieces. Slice the baguette in half the long way, and pull the center of the bread out of the baguette halves, leaving a cavity for the filling. Place the baguette halves under the broiler to lightly toast, 2 to 3 minutes. To assemble the bahn mi sandwich, spread each half of the toasted baguette with mayonnaise, and fill the cavity of the bottom half of the bread with broiled chicken, cucumber slices, pickled carrot, onion, and radish, cilantro leaves, and jalapeno pepper. Squeeze a wedge of lime over the filling, and top with the other half of the baguette.\\"","reviews":"Breaded some marinated tofu instead of chicken to keep this vegetarian - turned out AWESOME!'"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(t=>{const a=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return t.name.toLowerCase().includes(a)||t.steps.toLowerCase().includes(a)||t.description.toLowerCase().includes(a)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},G={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],_={key:0},V={key:1};function N(t,a,o,m,r,s){const h=w("PoemCard");return i(),n("section",null,[a[3]||(a[3]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 recipe 🥳")])],-1)),e("div",G,[a[2]||(a[2]=e("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(e("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":a[0]||(a[0]=l=>r.searchQuery=l),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,r.searchQuery]])]),e("div",E,[(i(!0),n(u,null,p(s.filteredPoems,(l,g)=>(i(),y(h,{key:g,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[1]||(a[1]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(i(),n("span",V,"Loading...")):(i(),n("span",_,"See more"))],8,O)):C("",!0)])}const J=c(H,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-f8543f00"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/35.md","filePath":"drive/35.md"}'),U={name:"drive/35.md"},Q=Object.assign(U,{setup(t){return(a,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[I(J)]))}});export{K as __pageData,Q as default};
