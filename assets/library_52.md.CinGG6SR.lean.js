I would definitely recommend this recipe to those looking to try out a simple, delicious lentil dish.

I drained the peppers and added 4 T. since I knew some of my family loves things hot.  I added a few teaspoons of milk since mine seemed dry.  I kept the mixture in the fridge over night to make sure they made nice balls to roll.  I used a #60 scoop, flatten them and rolled them in panko.  (My bread crumbs I make from whole wheat bread and I was afraid the they would be to dry when baked.  Plus I had panko to use up.)  I gave them a little spray with oil, which I think I'll skip next time since it didn't brown the crumbs.  I baked them closer to 20 minutes since mine were slightly bigger.

I did take suggestions and add more peppers.  I think I used 10 jalepeno peppers for a double batch - so it had some kick but surprisingly not crazy hot.  Plus I added a little green onion and a good bit of garlic powder.  I also added a bit of cheddar cheese, but suspect it was unnecessary to the end result.  And, chilling the mixture did help getting them rolled in the crumbs without being a goopy mess.  However, for the first batch (no time to chill)  I added a little of the crumbs to the mix so I could get a little ball into the breadcrumbs to roll them.  The end result was a little drier than when I just chilled the mix instead.  They still weren't excessively dry though, and guests would never know the difference! And for the crumbs, I used a few flavoured croutons (and ran out) and the rest just soda crackers whirred finely in the food processor.  I didn't find this too bland, as some suggested of the breadcrumbs - maybe because my mix was fairly flavorful.  I also actually used my mini muffin tin for these which worked just fine.  DH said he liked these WAYYYY better than regular poppers which he finds overwhelming with so much goopy cream cheese.  I have to agree!

We were looking for a lighter, non-mayo salad to have with grilled bratwurst, and this recipe to me was worth making the steam in the kitchen on a 90 degree evening. The chicken broth and mustard combination gives a lot of flavor. I did not use the chopped onion (although I definitely will next time), but added fresh chopped scallions from the garden to the finished product. I'm glad I did, as the appearance of the salad is pretty monotonous and needs some color for more eye appeal. I did not peel the red potatoes I used (I never do, it's a waste of good food unless they have a green tinge), and I still wanted a lot more color. I think cooked green beans or carrots would be a great addition to punch up the visual impact and add some crunch.<br/>This salad makes way more than four servings, in my opinion. I also object to the amount of salt, especially if you are using canned chicken broth that is not low sodium! A half teaspoon of salt per serving is just too much. I used half the salt called for and found it to be just fine. I also cut the amount of oil a bit, 1/4 cup instead of 1/3, and it didn't seem to be a problem.<br/>I do have one question for the contributor: what is meant by hot mustard? Dry mustard, which is inherently hot? A prepared mustard? I think that needs to be clarified. I used prepared Dijon mustard, which is hardly hot, but gives good flavor. If a dry powdered mustard is meant, I would be willing to try that, so I'm curious. I think the 2 teaspoons of dry mustard would help to thicken the dressing somewhat, as well."},{"name":"sister little s spice cake","steps":"mix all ingredients and pour into a greased pan', 'add spices to suit your taste', 'bake 20 minutes at 350'","description":"this is another family favorite passed on from one of the","ingredients":"flour', 'baking powder', 'salt', 'baking soda', 'brown sugar', 'shortening', 'molasses', 'ginger', 'clove', 'nutmeg', 'eggs', 'buttermilk'","review":"Have made this twice now.

I will make again!!"},{"name":"skillet apple streusel cake","steps":"heat oven to 350 grease a 9-10 bundt pan or a 10 cast iron skillet', 'make stueusel in a medium bowl combine brown sugar , apples , nuts , flour and cinnamon', 'stir in the melted butter', 'make the cake in a medium bowl combine flour , baking powder and baking soda mix well', 'in large bowl with a electric mixer on medium speed beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy', 'add eggs one at a time , beat well after adding each egg , add vanilla', 'set mixer to low alternate beating flour and orange juice into mixture', 'spoon half of cake mixture into pan then sprinkle with half of streusel', 'add remaining cake mix swirl with knife if desired to make a pattern', 'bake for 15 minutes remove from oven and sprinkle with the remaining streusel', 'bake for 30-35 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean', 'transfer to wire rack to cool completely', 'make the glaze- combine powdered sugar and orange juice , mix well and drizzle with a spoon over the top of cake and serve'","description":"using a cast iron skillet is just a different country way of making this cake you can use a traditional bundt pan if you wish. but using a skillet requires keeping a close eye on it since cast iron retains heat much better than other baking pans.\\n\\nyou can use cut up pears instead of apples for a different twist or even use both apples and pears. adding other fruits for the occasion and season is a great way to give someone a special treat, like cranbverries, raisins, raspberries. even just sprinkling some grated coconut on top or using in cake mixture is a different treat as well.","ingredients":"light brown sugar', 'granny smith apple', 'nuts', 'all-purpose flour', 'ground cinnamon', 'butter', 'baking powder', 'baking soda', 'white sugar', 'eggs', 'vanilla extract', 'orange juice', 'powdered sugar'","review":"I just tried this recipe using fresh Roma tomatoes.  As other reviewers noted, the roasting aroma was great.  I seeded but did not peel the tomatoes.  My blender is stored away so used my immersion blender.  No dice.  Should have peeled the tomatoes because I ended up with shreds of skin, chunks of garlic and chunks of onion.  So, tried my hand mixer and ended up with tomato puree flying all over the walls.  I still couldn't get it properly blended so ended up straining al those desirable bits out which also strained out all the good tomato pulp.  I ended with about 8 oz. of tomato juice.  It would have been worth it though, if the flavor lived up to so many glowing reviews.  In IMHO, it did not.  The flavor was thin, no body at all.  This was a big disappointment and a waste of time and money."},{"name":"skillet baked chocolate chip cookies","steps":"cream butter and both sugars', 'sift together the flour , baking soda , and salt', 'set aside', 'add the egg and vanilla to the butter mixture', 'add the flour mixture a little at a time', 'stir the chips and nuts in by hand', 'press into a 10 inch skillet and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes'","description":"this cookie comes out soft and is great cut like a pie and served with vanilla ice cream ( or chocolate). make sure you use an oven proof skillet, i use cast iron.","ingredients":"butter', 'sugar', 'light brown sugar', 'flour', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'egg', 'vanilla extract', 'chocolate chips', 'nuts'","review":"I was looking for a straightforward (but not boring) tomato soup for a case of winter blues, and I found some good roma tomatoes on sale.  I followed this recipe approximately but used dried herbs, none of the optional cheese, a little bit of crushed red pepper for a hint of heat and just a bit of milk to round things out.  I used my KitchenAid immersion blender and really liked the final texture.  I did not peel the tomatoes and didn't end up with any skin peels or other pieces.  The final texture wasn't as smooth as canned soup, but who wants that anyways?  Simple recipe with great classic flavors!"},{"name":"skillet barbecue pork chops","steps":"in a small bowl , combine garlic powder , ginger , and pepper', 'sprinkle mixture on both sides of pork chops', 'reserve any remaining garlic powder mixture', 'heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat', 'add pork chops , cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side , or until brown', 'in small bowl , combine ketchup , soy sauce , honey and any remaining seasoning', 'blend well', 'pour over chops', 'reduce heat to low and simmer 10 to 15 minutes or until chops are tender'","description":"quick and easy. serve with hot cooked rice or potatoes.","ingredients":"garlic powder', 'ginger', 'pepper', 'pork loin chops', 'oil', 'ketchup', 'soy sauce', 'honey'","review":"I made this for a friend who was sick.

I don't know if it was 2 pounds, but I used about 4 cups cherry tomatoes, only needed 1 cup of broth and kept everything else the same. All the tomato seeds/skins gave it a great texture. It definitey was not 6-8 serving though; maybe more like 3-4 if it's going to be a meal. I was really impressed with how easy it was to get such a satisfying, homemade soup, just roast and puree.

I used a lot more fresh herbs than called for in the recipe. I made two batches of tomatoes. The first batch was baked as directed, but I used more herbs. The second one, I layered the herbs on the bottom, placed the tomatoes on top of the herbs, and followed the recipe from there. We preferred the herbs on the bottom. I should also say that I did not measure anything (I usually don't). I only used 1 coup of broth at the end. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
