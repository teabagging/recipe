I had 18 extra-large shrimp, so I made 6 skewers of three each.  I made the marinade using 2 T. of McCormick's Hot Chili Seasoning Mix.  Coupled with the cayenne, the end result was quite spicy (but that's the way I like it).  Unfortunately, I forgot to add the tomato paste.  After marinating for several hours, I realized my mistake, and had to stir it in then.  It still combined well, and had another hour or so to marinate.  Since a thunderstorm was on the horizon, I ended up using the oven broiler.  These came out absolutely wonderfully, and were gone almost as soon as they reached the table.

I diced mined and added the whole thing to step 4.<br/><br/>3) Watch how much oil you use for step one.  I put about 3/8 into the bottom of a 12 saute pan, and that proved to be too much. 1/4 would have been much better.<br/><br/>4) After pulling the shrimp out of the oil, roll them on a paper towel and then layer them on wax paper in a bowl on the range top.  I used both of the left burners, and put my bowl of shrimp in the middle of the rangetop and the heat form the other burners kept the shrimp at eating temp.  This keeps them from sticking to the PT, and should allow you to add them later in step 4 so that they get some of the sauce, but don't lose that Cheesecake Factory crispiness.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>After making this a dozen times (this and Jakes Etouffee are my favorite recipes) I've posted a few improvements.  The recipe doesn't call for it but add the shallot with the tomato and Parmesan to the sauce.  More importantly, I doubled the amount of dry ingredients for covering the shrimp.  As you toss them in the flour mixture and set them aside they become damp looking again. When you finish coating them, toss them a second time.

I give five stars b/c of the ingredient list; healthy and simple.  For the recipe itself, which lends itself to additions and substitutions.  Taste was delicious and perfect for breakfast.  I do not like sweet things for breakfast, but rather something flavorful in a simple way.  These were not as sweet as cookies but not bland or lacking flavor in anyway.  Five stars for the idea too as I just cannot afford the Kind*brand bars; as terrific as they are, at 1.79 a piece i cannot afford that for my weekly breakfast, especially since my 3 yr old daughter eats one a day as well.  The texture was perfect.  Not cakey, not dry and crumbly at all, but not so chewey that it was ripping your teeth out either.  I would say just right and well balanced for texture.  I followed recipe with the following changes:  used all organic ingredients; I did half the recipe as I am a terrible baker and didnt want to waste ingredients if I botched it which I am known for.  I did add a bit more wheat flour than called for because i think in halfing it when i was looking at the dough it looked like it could have used a bit more flour; i could have been wrong though.  I made them into drop cookie shapes (i have bad luck with making bars) and in her breakfast cookies i added organic carob chips and roasted salted sunflower seeds,and dried chopped papaya.  In mine, the walnuts and roasted salted sunflower seeds.  I will be making these, hopefully, on a regular basis as i have been looking for a breakfast bar/cookie that was healthy and affordable, simple and delicious.  This is it.

There are actually 2 types of bread used for Braudterta - Loaf-type slices that are filled &amp; layered .. or .. Larger jelly-roll-type slices that are filled &amp; rolled. The jelly-roll-type slice is used more often &amp; all we could find. I made the filling a dy early using Icelandic baby shrimp, chilled it overnight &amp; assembled the terta today about 2 hrs prior to serving at an afternoon coffee for 9 (This prevents the bread from becoming soggy as the terta sits). 1 of the pitfalls of a specialty recipe like this when made by a cook familiar w/the &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; is they are on &quot;auto-pilot&quot; &amp; do what they know to be best. I admit to revising your recipe w/the use of cream cheese. For the filling, I used 1 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream &amp; 1/2 cup cream cheese (same total volume as recipe, but reduces the mayo &amp; sour cream). For the &quot;frosting&quot;, I used a combo of mayo &amp; cream cheese w/only a sml amt of sour cream. When chilled, both chgs make the terta less fragile to decorate, slice &amp; serve. Using the curved jelly-roll-type bread limits how you can garnish, so I kept it simple w/a layer of cucumber &amp; egg slices on top &amp; tomato slices served to-the-side. Lastly it was sprinkled w/dry parsley flakes plus Old Bay Seasoning as a matter of pers pref. Bottom Line: We loved it &amp; our guests loved it too.

In the oven it puffs up like a souffle but completely flattens within a few minutes of coming out of the oven.  It was still possible to tell where the edges of the bread were so it was easy to cut into individual sandwiches to eat in the living room with a fork for Christmas breakfast.  I used bacon cooked brown but not crisp and by morning you could easily cut it with a fork.  I added about a teaspoon of Cholupa hot sauce and it was just right for us - merely a hint of heat discernible by some, none at all noticed by most.  I had no green pepper so left it out but will use it or red pepper next time (maybe even something with some heat - we like spicy).  Instead of Special K, I topped it with crushed Ritz crackers and I am hoping there is still one piece left in the fridge for breakfast at work tomorrow.

I am surprised every time I take a bit how tasty they really are! Usually I like cookie dough more than the baked result, but these are one of the exceptions; they taste just as great. There's a great deep, rich (not overload, though; maybe vivid, or full-flavored?), almost creamy taste to them. The sweetness is just right. My only issue with them is that the dough behaved horribly when I tried to roll it out. I sprinkled confectioner's sugar on my rolling surface, rolling pin, and hands, and the dough still stuck. It was simultaneously too hard and too soft, it seemed. I had cooled it all night and let it come down in temperature a bit. I did have to work the first batch of dough a bit as it was too cold to be rolled, but even after that both batches seemed to fall apart on me. I found pressing the dough down with my hands to minimize the use of the rolling pin worked alright. I will confess that I forgot to mix the dry and wet ingredients seperately. I realize that could have been the source of my problems, but the dough was fully incorporated as evidenced by the even taste of the cookies. I would appreciate any constructive criticism! I also agree that cookies (at least mine) were not very aesthetically pleasing. For me, this was due to the excess confectioner's sugar on the cookies. It comes out looking like dried, crackled glaze. I also found the end product to be rather fragile and prone to easy breakage or crumbling. The same was true when I was rolling out the dough; the cookies were *very* fragile; I needed a dough scraper to lift them off the rolling surface as well. Aside from these mechanical problems, they do taste great, which genuinely surprised and pleased me. I would make these again for that reason alone, but I would probably try to fix the breakage problems."},{"name":"fake  n bake oven ranch chicken","steps":"place cleaned and dried chicken pieces in a large flat glass dish , dredge each piece in the ranch dressing , cover dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for 30-45 minutes', 'meanwhile , preheat oven to 450', 'coat 9 x 13 inch baking sheet with pam', 'mix potato flakes , paprika , parsley flakes and garlic powder in a flat dish', 'remove marinated chicken pieces from ranch marinade , then roll in potato flake mixture , coating thoroughly', 'arrange on baking sheet , then salt and pepper to taste', 'important: turn down oven to 350', 'bake approximately 35-45 minutes , or until the juices run clear when chicken pieces are pierced with a fork and the crust looks golden brown'","description":"i don't remember where i got this recipe, but i've tweaked it a bit to my own liking.  it's so simple, yet so flavorful, that it's become one of our absolute favorites in our list of easy after-work recipes!  my kids think i'm a real down-home cook whenever i make this!  lol!  note:  prep time does not include marinating time.","ingredients":"boneless skinless chicken breasts', 'skinless chicken drumsticks', 'hidden valley original ranch dressing', 'instant potato flakes', 'paprika', 'parsley flakes', 'garlic powder', 'salt & pepper'","review":"We loved this!!

and dumplings. my mother was given her recipe and served it quite often since it is very economical and delicious. i have been cooking them for about 20 years now and have added my own personal touches to the recipe. they are to be served in a bowl, not on a plate. it is the creamy, flavorful, gravy-like broth that makes them so delicious. i haven't changed anything about the wonderful dumplings.they are fluffy and soft.they are unbelievably simple to make and just remember don't over-wet or over-work the dough. this recipe would be perfect for a family reunion or church social. it will make exactly (20)  1-cup servings. it does taste good leftover just add a little water or milk when reheating and reheat slowly on low heat. enjoy!","ingredients":"chicken', 'onions', 'celery',

They are easy to personalize for my family with swiss cheese & mushrooms, pizza sauce & mozzerella, or my favorite, Velveeta cheese. I have used Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix in the past, but decided to try Rhodes brand frozen dough. I got the dough that was separated already to make rolls (not the frozen loaf). I thawed and raised the dough like I was making rolls, but then used it for the runza filling instead. Two rolls is the perfect amount for one runza, and you can shape it with your hand (similar to throwing a pizza crust, just not as large). I would shape one, put the filling on it, then shape another to seal on the top to make the pouch. It works much better for a kitchen with limited counter space because you don't have to roll out any dough.

Retired from the Navy in 1989 and have made them a few times myself. <br/>  I sometimes add carrot shavings, or thin strips of banana peppers, or even small chunks of celery to give it more flavor.  Some use canned sauerkraut rather than cooking cabbage, but I prefer fresh cabbage.

I tried making them myself after I left Nebraska, but didn&#039;t have a recipe and they weren&#039;t very good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To all those making substitutions and additions to the recipe;  you may be making something you like, but I wouldn&#039;t consider it a Runza.  Especially with cheese and pizza sauce.  Some things are just so naturally good that &quot;improvements&quot; only change it into something else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The older I get the more I appreciate the plain old fashioned recipes of my youth.
