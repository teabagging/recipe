Super, super easy to make and has such an amazing flavor!!!!  <br/>My whole family loves Mongolian Beef and we always order it at our favorite Chinese Restaurant, but, after making this recipe we will no longer be ordering this dish out!!!<br/>Couple of things I did was  I purchased 1 1/2 lbs of Flank Steak and I put the Flank Steak in the freezer until it was about 1/4 to 1/2 way frozen... this made it easy to slice the perfect slices of beef. I sliced the Flank Steak the day before I made this dish....<br/>Second thing I changed was I added a pinch maybe a pinch and a half of Red Pepper Flakes and sprinkled onion powder on the meat when you put the meat back in to the wok after disposing of the oil after frying.  This adds extra flavor and a kick if you like a little bit spicy food...<br/>Last thing I did was add lots more green onion.<br/>I served this dish with long grain white rice and there were no left overs between me, my husband and our two children.<br/>HUGE hit in our family!!!

Make sure there is enough oil in there to cover all the meat. Place all the meat in the oil not more than 30-45 seconds, and then temporarily put all of the meat in a bowl (glass preferably),\\n\\n4) Heat your wok until drops of water explode in it.

Usually you put the protein in first but since you have already cooked the meat in the oil you don&#039;t want to overcook it, so I do the onions first. After about 1 minute add some of the sauce to the onions. Now they have both the oil from the meat and the sauce mixed in with them. Pepper the onions to taste.\\n\\n6) Finally, add the meat and mix in the sauce and stir. I only had the meat cooking for about 3 minutes after I added it.\\n\\n7) Take the wok off the fire and push the meat and onions to the sides and away from the center of the wok so it doesn&#039;t cook any more.

After reading comment #2, I made a note to turn up the heat - I've had trouble getting yeast doughs to rise in winter because we keep our thermostat on 65F. I had no problems with this one after turning it up to 70F for a couple hours. Another cause of non-rising dough is bad yeast - age and a few other things can kill it, so it won't be activated by warm liquid + sugar (which is what causes it to rise). It's best to store yeast in the fridge, and make sure it's the first ingredient you grab when you get ready to prepare dough - set it on the counter to let it warm a bit as you set up everything else. After everything is at hand, warm up the milk. By then, the yeast won't be shocked by a sudden change in temps. Also, try using whole milk instead of low- or non-fat. Lactose-free milk will NOT work, because it lacks milk sugar (lactose) which the yeast needs to feed on in order to multiply. Don't worry if you're lactose intolerant - the yeast will consume the lactose in regular whole milk, so it won't affect your tummy.

That's why some people have trouble with it. After making them, my wife and I have three general reactions. The first, and perhaps most important, is that the recipe for the dough is not all that important ... your favorite brioche type dough will do the job. Just make sure it is well kneaded dough to give the final product some structure  and the crumb some stringiness. These are too cakey. Secondly, don't put the filling in before hand ... it is easier, and more authentic to do them as full rounds, let them cool (glaze while hot) and fill afterward with a pastry bag. Letting them cool allows the cooked dough to stabilize ... if you put the filling in while the dough is hot, it will collapse and get gummy around the filling. Not too much filling either ... authentic paczki have a wee dollip of filling (2t) just to add a bit of contrasting flavor. Finally, 3, the dough per paczki should be about 2 oz in weight.

I don't know if every bread maker would give the same result or if my Zo just really let me down on this. The sauce it's self ended up lovely and tart and I have no problem recommending that part at all. The problem was the bread maker, it didn't get hot enough to make all (or even most) of the berries pop and it was like the berries were just sitting on red water. Not wanting to sit through another 1:20 cycle I just put it all in a lidded pot and simmered the lot for 15 mins. At the end of that time when I took the lid off all of the berries had popped and there was thickening happening, yay. If I try this in the Zo again I'll chop the berries first. Oh! and I did add some extra sugar as the juice I use is organic and unsweetened.

I have to confess, I have never tried a Monte Cristo sandwich before. It is one I know my mom likes but I never could get past putting jam & powdered sugar on my meat Sammy. I decided to triple this recipe & try it out while we had family in town to help us eat all the extra food from the RSC recipes I wanted to make. Luckily, my brother-in-law had eaten a Monte Cristo many times before & would be able to help me make a good comparison. I was completely surprised by the way the raspberry preserves complemented the ham & turkey. The honey-mustard sauce was also a nice surprise & only one of us opted out of it for personal preference. We used several different types of breads, including sourdough, French & buttermilk. Everyone liked the taste of their sandwich (even the picky eaters). My only concern was that the method for coating the sammies with egg led to soggy bread, even on the French & sourdoughs. I poured, flipped, & put them immediately on the griddle (big enough to cook most of them all at once) but even in that short time they had soaked too much. Some began to fall apart while cooking & the end result was not as crispy as we would have expected. I will definitely make these again but will just dip & flip each Sammy like French toast, without letting them lay in the wet mixture.

However, the amounts were way off for me.  I made Miller's Puff Pastry recipe #16834 and measured my 6 four inch squares, and filled each square with 2 tablespoons of the spinach mixture and I still had over half the spinach mixture left.  I had enough pastry to make 1-2 more and still had a huge amount of spinach mixture left over.  I'm going to wrap it in a tortilla and bake it sometime in the next couple of days.  Luby you might want to recheck the original recipe.  Or do tell, I certainly could have messed it up, but I'm pretty darn sure I followed the recipe to a T.  Anyway, this is certainly worth trying, bearing in mind that you may have extra filling.  One other think, the egg yolk brushing makes these look like you put a thin coat of mustard on it before baking.

Fast, easy, low mess factor and so good. The only thing I changed was having to use about 1/4 cup of fat free half and half for 1/4 of the cream, with that adjustment, I increased the cooking time after adding the cream by about 5 minutes, to reduce it down a bit. When the sugar/butter is caramelizing, make sure to keep a very close watch on it and do stir it frequently, as sugar that is caramelizing does develop hot spots that are heating faster than other areas and can burn, while the rest is not. I found two things helpful, a silicone scraper spatula, because it can hold up to the heat, and also a wire whisk, to evenly distribute the hot spots and when adding the cream. If you are unsure of what is the deep amber color you need to achieve, chill a plate in the freezer for a few minutes and place a few drops of the caramelizing mixture on it. It should cool and harden almost immediately into a very brittle ball, holding it's shape. It will have a distinct caramel taste to it  when tasted. Please use care in making this, as it caramelizes, it gets to over 300 degrees and can cause severe burns. Also, when adding the cream, do so very slowly and with forewarning that it creates a huge amount of steam and bubbles, as the cream is cold when added, if you don't heat it first. Even if you heat the cream first, it still causes a bit of reaction. Don't let this scare you off, this is so easy to do, even as a first timer you are likely to succeed with fabulous results. This is very thick when cold and and thin but not runny when very warm.

I wound up mixing ground beef and rice together since everyone said that it didn't seem to make as much as the recipe suggested and we got about 8 burritos out of it.  I also quadrupled the paste mixture, except I only doubled the cinnamon, cumin and red pepper flakes.  I also added in some paprika (about 2 tsp), just because I like it.  When I added the paste to the pan, I also added about 1/2 cup of water for a saucier burrito.  The only thing I think I will do differently next time is that I would chop up the cucumber and put it in a strainer for a bit to get rid of some of the liquid.  On my first bite the sauce rocketed out of the bottom of my burrito like a geyser, but I will say that it tasted very good.  I also stirred the onions into the sauce since that's how I've always made tzatziki and it softens the onions after it sits for a bit.

No one can tell it is gluten free!  I have used potato starch, but prefer tapioca flour, and have found that half and half brown/white rice flour gives a nice combination of taste and texture.  When I use Bob's Red Mill brand brown rice flour, I use all brown rice flour (it is more finely ground).  I use three whole eggs instead of just whites, substitute canola oil for the butter (and use 3 Tbsp so I don't have to brush the top with butter), and maple syrup for the sugar.  I use apple cider vinegar for the vinegar.  To make sandwich bread, I put the whole recipe worth of dough into a sandwich loaf pan and bake for a little bit longer.  So wonderful!\\n\\nOriginal review: I used brown rice flour and substituted potato starch for the tapioca flour.  I also used maple syrup instead of sugar.  It turned out excellently!

See Bob's Red Mill site if you are interested in recommended proportions for different recipes.  <br/>Although the rice and tapioca flours are 'safe' flours with a more neutral taste, I tend to prefer working with combinations of other flours  for about a third the flour amount for the increased vitamins and proteins that they offer.

We thought maybe our olive oil was rancid. We made another batch with margarine on the top. The funky taste was still there. The third batch we we switched to white distilled vinegar, and it was still gross. So we figured it had to be one of the flours. So my husband started smelling them and found it was the tapioca. I don't know if our flour is bad or if that is just how it tastes. I've never noticed it taste bad like that in any of the other recipes I've used it in. Other than that the bread is delicious.

I made some with a mix (Pamela&#039;s) and I made my own mix or blend of flours. Not overly fond of Pamela&#039;s, it&#039;s too sweet for my taste, but still a good bread mix for other things. I made an artisan bread recipe, it fell in the middle and was very wet and doughy and I cooked it the time suggested. I made a french bread recipe, it fell and was doughy, again. I almost gave up. I made this recipe today and it ROCKS!!! It is the closest thing I have ever come to real, wheat french bread. I can only say that I am in heaven as I eat a meatball sandwich with my own gluten free turkey/chicken meatballs and this bread, nobody in my big Italian family would ever know it was gluten free OR that the meatballs were gluten free (used one of my fallen french bread recipes for gluten free bread crumbs, mixed with Italian seasoning and baked in the oven for 10 minutes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the only sub I made (I hate it when people substitute and then say the recipe doesn&#039;t work!) was that I used 1 cup of super fine brown rice flour and 1 cup of super fine white rice flour. Everything else was the same. I did not use the egg replacer, not sure why that is in there? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I baked it in my regular oven in a french bread pan (I have a triple pan, I only used 2 of them and I lined it with parchment paper). I baked it for 40 minutes. After 20 minutes, I tented it with Aluminum, as I don&#039;t like a dark crust. PERFECT!!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks GlutenFreeGirl!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I did leave the door ajar and didn&#039;t take it out for 5 minutes in case it fell, which it did not.
