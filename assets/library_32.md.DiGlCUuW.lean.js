I want a layered cake, so what i did was to split the batters into 2 x 2 layered cakes, then stacked them up afterwards. 2) Frosting recipe turned out runny. I made a marshmallow frosting thats what i used. Yum! I also used a smaller cake tin (7inches) which resulted to a higher layered cake (remember 2 x 2 layers!). Quite impressive, I must say!

I like to assemble enough enchiladas for another pan and freeze them on a cookie sheet, when they're frozen I put them in a large freezer bag. When it's time for dinner- all I do is make the sauce to put on top and place it on top of the frozen enchiladas. I cover it with foil & cook it around 30 minutes. Then I remove the foil, add the cheese on top and cook another 15-20 minutes."},{"name":"pumpkin quick bread","steps":"stir together pumpkin , milk , sour cream , eggs and vanilla until blended', 'mix in raisins , cranberries and spices', 'add corn flour and blend well', 'mix salt and baking powder with all-purpose flour , then blend into the rest of the batter', 'stir until all ingredients are moistened', 'pour into two lightly greased loaf pans and place in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes or until tester in center comes out dry', 'if using silicone molds , let cool for at least 10 minutes before removing from the pans'","description":"pumpkin pie, but in a bread!","ingredients":"fresh pumpkin puree', 'sweetened condensed milk', 'sour cream', 'brown sugar', 'vanilla', 'cinnamon', 'ground nutmeg', 'ground ginger', 'salt', 'baking powder', 'all-purpose flour', 'cornflour', 'eggs', 'raisins', 'dried cranberries'","review":"Was good! wife liked the sour cream sause. will make again. skipped onion"},{"name":"pumpkin quick bread  abm bread machine","steps":"spray bread machine with nonstick cooking spray', 'in a bowl , mix first 4 ingredients until well blended', 'stir in baking powder , soda , salt , spices , and flour until just mixed', 'pour mixture into bread machine pan', 'set bread machine to quick or cake cycle', 'add chopped nuts at the beep , if using', 'when complete , carefully loosen the loaf and turn out onto a rack to cool'","description":"called a quick bread because chemical leavening is used rather than yeast. this recipe should work for any standard-sized bread machine with a cake or quick bread cycle. cooking/passive time depends on your machine.","ingredients":"vegetable oil', 'eggs', 'pumpkin puree', 'granulated sugar', 'baking powder', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'ground cinnamon', 'nutmeg', 'ginger', 'all-purpose flour', 'walnuts', 'nonstick cooking spray'","review":"Delicious!

I had a similar recipe from my mom. I did tweak the recipe per my laziness and tastes: instead of the fresh chicken breast I used 2 16oz cans of tyson chicken. It is in the can cooked, but I still 'cooked' it in the frying pan with the butter and onion as if it werent to get rid of that 'canned' taste. Plus using canned chicken made it easier to make it shredded chicken which is what I wanted. It breaks up real easy. The next thing I did was followed KansasGirls recomendation on using the can of Rotel Tomatoes with the green chilies mixed in. I think it was an excellent addition , and I mixed it right in when the recipe called for the chilies. I did not however use an additional can of chilies. I used the Rotel as a substitute. I also put refried beans on the inside before putting the chicken mixture on top and only made 4 tortillas instead of 8 so that I could have 4 stuffed tortillas.

It wasn't the greatest thing I've ever made, but it was good for what it was! As for changes, I adapted some of the suggestions from other reviewers here, including adding garlic and cumin to the chicken-and-onion part of the recipe. I also tried to chop the chicken up as much as I possibly could, instead of just dicing it, per someone's advice here, and I think that worked out well. I'm also a big cheese fan, so I put a lot more of the monterey jack cheese both in and on top of the enchiladas than what the recipe mentioned, and I also added some leftover shredded mild cheddar cheese to both the inside and top of 'em. I used two cans of green chiles instead of just one, and I also added jalapenos (and a bit of the jalapeno juice), for some extra kick and flavor, on top of the enchiladas once all of the other ingredients were on top and before I put it all into the oven. Anywho, partnered the enchiladas with some quick Spanish rice for dinner that first night, and it was just great! Ate up all of the leftovers during the following few days. I'll probably make this again at some point... The only thing I could see doing differently is being sure to not have them in the oven for too long - the top was a bit hardened and crunchy rather than the softer, borderline-liquidy layer I had anticipated. It was still great and probably didn't make much difference, as everything underneath that layer was surely soft and moist, but would still like to try for next time!"},{"name":"pumpkin souffle","steps":"preheat oven 350 degrees', 'beat egg whites til form firm peaks', 'beat egg yolks in a lg bowl , stir in pumpkin , sugar , yogurt , cream , butter , orange peel , and nutmeg', 'fold in beaten egg whites', 'spoon into 10 custard cups and bake 20-25 minutes', 'you may also spoon into 1 quart souffle dish and bake 1hr and 20mins or until knife inserted comes out clean'","description":"this is a lovely souffle i like to serve after dinner :-) cook time is time to cook in custard cups. if cooked in souffle dish, time is approx. 1hr 20 mins.","ingredients":"eggs', 'pumpkin', 'light brown sugar', 'plain yogurt', 'light cream', 'butter', 'orange zest', 'ground nutmeg'","review":"This is a great base recipe to get experimental with!

I cooked the chicken breasts in a crock pot with 3 stalks of celery and 1 whole, chopped onion, seasoned with pepper & Adobo garlic salt. I let that cook until done. Set the chicken aside, and took all the veggies, juice from crock pot & a can of chopped green chiles and pureed adding broth to that to equal the amount called for in the recipe. Made the roux...and the rest of the recipe as follows. Loved it. Kids all but licked their plates (unknowingly eating onions, celery and onions). Served with my black beans and rice.

It did seem to me that the chicken would benefit from some seasoning, so I added about a half envelope of chicken taco seasoning that I happened to have on hand, along with a splash of the homemade stock made from the remainder of the rotisserie chicken, which I used in the sauce as well.  I used Mezzetta brand fire-roasted chili peppers, which taste a little smokey and have lime juice, cilantro and garlic added to lend extra deliciousness and a punch of flavor to the peppers.  I used a combination of monterey jack and sharp cheddar cheeses, just because that is what I had.  This recipe was as good as the sour cream chicken enchiladas I have had at a well known restaurant.  I believe theirs had spinach added, and I think that would taste great, too.   I scattered some diced roma tomatoes and cilantro leaves over the top, which made a very pretty presentation.

First, though the recipe says to mix all ingredients together, a better result comes from first mixing all the dry ingredients together then mixing the wet ingredients together in a separate bowl and combining the two together.  The less you work a quick bread batter, the better your finished product.  In making this I noticed that the balance of wet and dry ingredients was a little off kilter with more liquid than one might normally need.  Since I had not yet added the milk, I decided to omit it.  Another option might have been to omit the applesauce or to have used more dry ingredients; both of these are speculations.  The results for me were just right a thick batter but one soft enough to pour from the bowl.  More liquid would have given me something like pancake batter.  Leaving these detailed results because my bread was just delicious, tender and moist with just the right amount of crumb to it.  With three mashed bananas it had a great fruity flavor that was elevated by the cinnamon.  I reduced the nutmeg by half as it was not a favorite of my friends.  I loved that the bread was fairly healthy and yet had the richness of breads loaded with butter, shortening or oil.  Delicious and well worth trying (again and again).
