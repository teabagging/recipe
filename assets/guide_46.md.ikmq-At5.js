The combined amount of raspberries is appx. 4 1/2 c. before washing. I did gently wash the berries in a colander and drained them as much as possible. The original 1 c. of sugar called for in this recipe produced a tortuously tart result for me (I could barely swallow it down, even with a little vanilla ice cream), so I upped the sugar to 1 1/2 c., and thought it just right. I also threw in an optional 1/8th tsp. cinnamon. I always place my pies on the BOTTOM rack of my oven in order to have a cooked bottom crust, and I also use pie savers on the rim. My pie cooked at 425 degrees for 30-40 minutes, rotating 180 degrees midway through for even browning. I let the pie cool thoroughly -- overnight -- and it set and cut well. This is an easy-peasy recipe, but delicious. In other words, 5 stars!!

 Seriously,  this is the best I've ever made and I'm VERY picky about lasagna!  I think a lot a lasagna recipes have a sauce that's much too sweet and not cheesy enough .  This was exactly what I was hoping for!  For years Ia?ve been using Better Homes & Gardens Classic Lasagna recipe thinking it was the best until  I found this one.   Ia?m confused by those who think this was way too salty.  Maybe they put in a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.  The only change I made was to add some muenster cheese, just because I like a lot of cheese and I only used two layers of no-bake noodles.  I think simmering the sauce for as long as you recommended was a real key to the taste.  Excellent!

I was short a tbsp parsley when it came to the cheese mixture but all in all this is one excellent recipe.

Not overly saucy, so it holds together well and slices beautifully. Great flavour! My fiance had never had - and didn't think he'd like - a lasagna with cottage cheese, but he really likes this one!\\n\\nDidn't have Italian Sausage so used 2 lb ground beef. Used  fresh herbs in place of dried, and added rosemary to the mix. Didn't have 2 cans of tomatoes so used about a half dozen tomatoes from my garden (diced) with 1 can of stewed tomatoes. For the cottage cheese part I added one thawed and drained brick of frozen chopped spinach as another reviewer suggested to sneak in more veggies, as well as a generous grating of nutmeg (my no-so-secret ingredient for Italian cooking). I also opted to use the ready-to-bake noodles rather than the kind that need boiling, just because they're easier to handle and cuts down on clean up time.\\n\\nI didn't want to make a full 9x13 pan of lasagna for just the two of us, so I did up two 8 x 8 foil square pans (each of which will feed us for 2 days). This resulted in lots of leftover filling, so using what I had on hand I also got two 6 round and one 4 round pie tins - perfect for single servings! Baked one of the 8 pans to eat right away, and the others went into the freezer for easy suppers later on. \\n\\nThanks for a great recipe!"},{"name":"italian turkey burgers  reduced fat","steps":"put the turkey in a bowl and set aside', 'roughly chop the onion and put it into a food processor or mini chopper along with the basil , red peppers and sun dried tomatoes', 'blitz the ingredients until the onions and everything else is finely chopped', 'empty the contents of the food processor into the bowl with the ground turkey', 'add the garlic powder and the egg white', 'mix with your hands until everything is well combined', 'form four equal sized burgers and place on a plate and put into the fridge for an hour to firm up', 'take the burgers out of the fridge and either pan fry in a little bit of extra virgin olive oily for about 5 minutes on each side until cooked through or do on a foreman type grill for about 10 minutes total', 'serve on buns of simply bunless with a salad is watching the calories', 'if serving with bread it is fun to complete the italian feel with ciabatta rolls'","description":"i have been playing around lately with trying to make different kinds of reduced fat burgers to go with the low fat eating plan i am on.  this is my latest attempt.  i used ground turkey breast so that i didn't feel that bad about having a little bit of fat from the sundried tomatoes but at least it is 'good' fats.  the cooking time includes the one hour chilling time.","ingredients":"ground turkey breast', 'onion', 'fresh basil', 'roasted sweet red pepper', 'sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil', 'garlic powder', 'egg white'","review":"Wow!

I chose a larger glass pyrex that I have - it's about 10x14.  I thought that leaving off with the noodles was strange, but I figured the sauce would come up and around during baking.  It didn't, and the top was all hard and dried out.  Although the fillings/layers covered the area, they were thin, and the result was a very dry, crumbly lasagne.  I couldn't taste the sausage.  it was very disappointing.  I had about 2/3 of the pan left after dinner (for 5).

This was my first time making Lasagna in the oven and not the crock pot. I dont think I will ever do it any other way again. After reading other reviews, here is what I did.<br/>I doubled the sauce (were saucy people) and we dipped our garlic toast in the left over sauce. I used only ground beef, because it is what I had on hand. I used Italian seasoning instead of the other seasonings. 2 TBSP of brown sugar in the sauce. I put my cheese mixture right into my meat sauce. I find it easier to layer that way. It was to die for! I feel like I am going to roll everywhere because I ate so much!

The total time from start to finish, including all prep work and letting the lasagna rest for 20 minutes after baking, was around 4 hours. It was WELL worth the money, time and effort though! This was, hands down, the BEST lasagna I&#039;ve ever had! My wife agreed and said I am the official lasagna maker from now on.

This recipe is mediocre at best! First, the ratios are off and it makes way too much filling for a normal lasagna pan.

Third, the filling isn&#039;t very saucy, mostly just some ground beef with some tomatoes mixed in, and then they top the whole thing with the noodles above the sauce. At least they say to top with mozzerella, but it&#039;s not enough to keep the noodles from drying out! So, if you want a bunch of ground beef layered with some weird quiche-like semi-cheese stuff topped with dried noodles, go ahead and make this dish!

(Bc the noodles once baked will continue to soak up liquid). I like mine a little saucy. Also, 2 TBSP of brown sugar cuts the and is a must. Might seem like a lot but it's not. To smooth out the sauce I added about 1/3 cup cream (half n half). Bake time and temp worked great. &gt;&gt;Not re: the rating, I prefer to add another 1/2 lb mozzarella than what's instructed on the top bc we like ours cheesy! (Not changing the filling recipe).

She also has a sourdough bread recipe to go with it #13716 it's outstanding. I think the potato water really kicked up my starter. I used 1 cup of my starter(the whole thing) and added 2 cups of flour and 2 cups warm water and 1t. sugar. Stirred it all together and let it sit out all night. In the morning, after washing my starter jar, I put 1 cup plus alittle more back into the jar and into the fridge for next time. What I had left in the bowl I added the egg, oil, sugar, salt and 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup warm milk. Stirred well and let sit for 1 hour. I like my batter thick, but add less flour for thinner pancakes. My pancakes came out fluffy, slightly sour, and a little chew to them. This was so good.

One suggestion is cutting back the baking time...I know ovens vary but even with me reducing the heat to 340 (due to dark pans) and baking 25 minutes this cake was still a bit overdone so my suggestion is to just watch the time and test your cakes after 20 minutes or so.  Make sure you use parchment and if you use just a circle in the bottom make sure to grease/spray the sides as being a denser cake it needs to have a bit to easily remove from the pans.
