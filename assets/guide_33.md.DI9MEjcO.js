I would recommend when measuring everything out and adding to the bowl, to measure the oil and THEN the honey, as the oil will allow the honey to slide right out of the measuring spoon.  When baking I had to convert celsius to farenheit and came up with something btwn 325-350 degrees. I ended up removing it from the oven after 25 mins because it was beginning to look too dark and to smell like it was starting to burn a bit.

Avocado oil doesn&#039;t have a strong &quot;avocado&quot; taste; instead it lends a mellow finish, but it boasts a very high smoke point, so it is perfect for stir-frying.  For example, I think olive oil imparts too strong a flavor for shrimp, but avocado oil is perfect for shrimp.

It was while they were frying I read the reviews and noticed the comments on the water (I kind of wondered while making it, but just made it like it was because I was running short on time). I added more cornstarch and flour and the next round was terrific. If you're looking for something with a lot of seasoning, you'll have to add your own...salt, garlic powder and pepper are minimal seasoning in my opinion. I liked it as it was (when the batter was thicker, it stuck to the slices and fried up very nicely), even with the minimal seasoning, and think it's a great base for something even zestier or spicy, just add more seasoning.
