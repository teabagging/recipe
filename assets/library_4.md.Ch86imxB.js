After reading the reviews, I had to try it!  I halved the ingredients simply b/c I only have one loaf pan.  It turned out PERFECTLY!  This is an incredible poundcake recipe.  The texture is perfect - dense, but not heavy.  Almost velvety.  Some reviewers found it too sweet, but I didn't think that it was too sweet at all.  I actually doubled up on the vanilla, but I may try lemon next time instead, just as a variation.  I didn't time it, but I would say cooking time is definitely between 1.5-2 hours.  Make sure to butter and flour the pan, and when it's finished, allow it to cool for 5-10 minutes in the pan, or until it pulls away from the sides.  Then the cake will fall right out of the pan without sticking.  I will probably use this recipe for the rest of my life - so easy and sooooooooo good.

I would like to suggest that those that had issues used too much flour.  You must fluff the flour and then lightly spoon it into your measuring cup and lightly level off.  If you use the dipping method, you will end up with too much flour.  Also, in my experience, you cannot over beat the fats.  If your butter starts to separate, throw it out and start all over.  Pound cakes are tricky and I think these are the two main causes of failure.  This is extremely high fat.  If you worry about fat calories and grams, this would not be the recipe for you!

I used a 4 lb chicken and cooked it an additional 10 mins during step 2. I also drizzled the honey chipotle sauce on the chicken instead of brushing because it just seemed easier. I tasted the sauce and it was spicy but once it hit the chicken and cooked it lost it spiciness. :( That was the only disappointment in this recipe.

I used 3/4 cup water, 1/2 cup regular oats (I didn't have quick-cooking), a handful of golden raisins, 1 Tbsp of dark brown sugar, and a hefty sprinkling of cinnamon.  I also decided to add in a bit of unsweetened soy milk, prob 1/8 of a cup worth, to the water and pineapple mixture and then boiled on stove.  I added the rest of the ingredients in, stirring often and cooked over medium heat, mixture was still boiling calmly and i just watched it till it all began to thicken and soften, then I removed from heat and covered for a few mins.  I really didn't time this.  This was great!  Smelled awesome while cooking and the pineapple is nice, a little tang and a nice change too.  The oatmeal was not too watery and was just a bit creamy from the little bit of soy milk I used.  I left the pineapple in chunks, too, which was fine.

I've never had mac and cheese with tomatoes before and I definitely didn't hate it :) Make sure to use sharp cheddar cheese as the flavor would have been lacking without it. After all, this dish is all about the cheese! The cayenne adds a nice little kick at the end that you barely notice the spiciness of but makes a difference and adds complexity. Totally recommend!

Even though I added the cayenne pepper, I still added a few dashes of Tabasco Green Pepper Sauce to my serving on my plate, while my husband added regular Tabasco to his. We felt the Tabasco gave this dish a nice kick! I subbed 3 cups of Rotini pasta for the 2 cups of elbow macaroni, plus I subbed stewed tomatoes for the diced tomatoes, and I used 2% milk instead of the 1%. After I added the flour to the butter, I only needed to cook that for about 1 minute, then I gradually stiired in the milk and half-and-half, and cooked that for about 4 minutes to thicken up the sauce, to make it creamy, and for the lumps of flour to disapear. I then turned off the heat, and added the 3 cups of shredded cheese; stirring continuously til the cheese melted. In another saucepan, I heated the broth and stewed tomatoes along with the already cooked pasta for just a few minutes, then added that to the cheesy-creamy sauce in a 2-1/2 quart casserole baking dish, and baked the mac 'n' cheese for 22 minutes. This was a nice twist on mac 'n' cheese. Enjoyed the tomatoes in this dish, and enjoyed the aroma of the cheese after I took it out of the oven. It tasted ever so good when I reheated it in the microwave. Lori, I'm looking forward to making this again.

The cake was heavier than I had expected.  I've found in the past that sour cream batter wasn't quite as dense as this.  Don't get me wrong...it's really good.  Because it is more filling, it could easily serve 10 - 12.  I didn't have any brown sugar, but used white very successfully, and used Cortlands.  I also baked this in a 10 springform pan which took 55 minutes to cook through.  Unmolding was a dream.  This is also very good the next day.  Next time, I think I might add in some cinnamon.  Either to the apple mixture, or maybe even the cake batter.

Flaxseed- 75% of the health benefits contained in flaxseeds oxidizes within 15 minutes after you grind it. And is lost. Eating them whole, they pass right on through. So it is always good to grind it and eat within 15 minutes. If you'd like to add something similar (health wise) to the granola that will contain it until eaten. You can use chia seeds.

For others who will make this, and you should, it's fairly important to cut the potatos relatively small.

Another option would be to add the peas about 10 or 15 minutes into the simmering time.  I was also a little unclear if the tomato soup was in concentrated or reconstituted form -- ultimately I chose the later.
