The commissary didn't have any Rollos, so I used Dove caramel chocolates and Reeses miniature cups.  To distinguish between the two, I made markings on the top of each cookie before baking.  Baking these for about 9 minutes left the cookies still soft after cooling for ten minutes.  I absolutely recommend this cookie to anyone!

I did make the following modifications though: \\nStarted with fat free, strawberry cheesecake flavored yogurt (four individual 5.3oz Dannon Light and Fit Greek yogurts--would only need three to get the 16oz called for in the recipe, but I wanted to ensure decent sized portions...cheesecake is my all-time favorite dessert and I miss it terribly). Strained for 24hrs--wrapped in cheesecloth and tied off into a taut ball--even though the Dannon is &quot;Greek&quot; and already thick...and quite a bit of water drained out. Beat into one container of fat free cream cheese with the cheesecake flavored Jell-O packet (omitting the Splenda completely, as the yogurt is already sweetened and I can&#039;t stand the aftertaste of large amounts of artificial sweetener anyway). \\nYou could stop here, but I made a graham cracker crust using three full sheets of low fat, honey graham crackers (1.5 servings, according to the box), crumbled and held together with two tbsp of plain, fat free Greek yogurt. It took a bit of mashing in the pie plate to get it to stick together (four crackers with three tbsp yogurt might work better), but worth the effort. Topped with the filling, chilled, and...wonderful. The texture is more really thick mousse than cheesecake, but it&#039;s the first out of countless attempts that satisfied the craving. \\n105 cal, 0.4g fat, 14g carbs and 6g sugar/serving if cut into eighths, and they&#039;re hefty portions. Something like 77 cal for just the filling without the crust. \\nWill make again, and again, and again. The only change I might make would be to maybe use a sweetened yogurt for the crust, as it had a slight bitter taste to me, but now I&#039;m just being picky as it&#039;s hardly noticeable. \\nSo great, and the first fat free, low cal dessert I&#039;ve made in years that doesn&#039;t taste full of chemicals (though I know there are plenty in all that fat free/low calorie/fake sugar/diet stuff...for an occasional treat, totally worth it)."},{"name":"confetti cucumber salad","steps":"heat the oil in a pan and fry the garlic over medium heat until crispy , set aside to cool', 'mix the vinegar and sugar together', 'in a bowl , toss together the chopped onion , bell pepper , and cucumbers', 'pour the vinegar / sugar mixture and the chili sauce over the salad and toss', 'add the cooled garlic and toss', 'upon serving , sprinkle the chopped peanuts over the salad', 'enjoy !'","description":"this cucumber salad is lower in fat than the one that i grew up with, but it's packed with flavor.  very good during the summer on a hot day on the side of pretty much anything you could possibly want to eat.  a cook out must.","ingredients":"cucumbers', 'yellow bell pepper', 'red onion', 'garlic', 'olive oil', 'vinegar', 'sugar', 'sweet chili sauce', 'peanuts'","review":"I used Greek Yogurt and omitted one step.

I made this as written twice but thought the crust was too dark(an unappealing almost burned brown color) at 350 degrees using my Bravetti Platinum Pro deep fryer. So on the third try I changed it to 325 degrees...MUCH better.(same frying time 10 minutes for a very large vidalia onion) Now for the other challenge the recipe did not state how long to par-boil the onion. The first try I did six minutes but flower collapsed. The second try I cut the time in half to 3 minutes but the onion was almost raw and the petals did not coat properly except on the outside. The third try I did 5 minutes which I think is about right EXCEPT the flower collapsed again after coating due to the weight. (everything tasted wonderful but was visually unaesthetic). I THINK the problem might be resolved by NOT cutting the core all the way through to the other side and instead leave the base intact 1/2- 3/4. Anyone here have a similar experience and would like to share their strategy? One other alteration I made on the third try was reducing the amount of buttermilk from 1 cup to 3/4 cup. It may have been the brand I was using but on the first two attempts I thought the batter was too thin. After I reduced it to 3/4 cup I thought the coating clung much better.

I put the turkey aside after browning, then sauteed fresh garlic and onions until soft and fragrant.

When the list said canned tomatoes, I wasn't quite sure what to use.  I had some diced tomatoes in the pantry, so I used those.  I used half with no added flavoring or salt and half with Italian flavor seasonings.  I thought it would be too much liquid using diced tomatoes, so I drained most of it off.  I wasn't sure I should have done that, but it worked out well for us.  Also, I didn't have onion on hand -- I have a very hard time cutting and chopping onions as they always burn my eyes to the point that they water so badly I can't see, and someone else always has to finish the job for me.  I've started using leeks in place of onion.  I get the same flavor without the burning eyes.  The leeks worked well in this recipe, too.  We thought the flavor was 5-star quality, but we both felt it could have used a little less salt.  Next time, I will omit the salt entirely and add it afterward, if necessary.

It would have been better to have mixed softened cream cheese with the salsa and the spices so that it could be smooth and well-mixed then mixing that with the veggies and chicken.

It looked pretty good at first, but there seem to be some things missing. First, the step to strain the sauce is missing. I can&#039;t imagine trying to eat the noodles while avoiding bits of ginger, garlic and onion. So I did strain it, but then, it looked like there might not be enough. You don&#039;t use such a lot of sauce on this kind of noodles, but, even for 2 servings, I think it is a close thing. I haven&#039;t experimented, but I think I&#039;d prefer the sauce to have a stronger vinegar taste, too. The next big thing is that the recipe suggests that you eat the noodles with only cucumber (or carrot) and coriander leaves. If this is a light meal, which is how I would treat this kind of dish, then I&#039;d like cucumber, ham, egg, tomato, pickled ginger, and maybe even a few slices of roast chicken, along with the coriander. And with hot Chinese mustard on the side. Sprinkling sesame seeds over the top is fine.

I also had 4 really ripe bananas from making banana bread the week before using a different recipe because I didn&#039;t have this recipe with me at the time.

They were both done baking so (knowing the banana bread was going to be so so so good I attacked that one first, offering my son a piece.  He was like, &quot;no mom, that&#039;s okay.&quot;  Then he stared at the piece and (as if under a banana bread spell), popped it in his mouth.  Two minutes later he came downstairs with a huge hunk of banana bread, apple crisp still unsampled.  Moist, dreamy, rich, crispy on top, this one&#039;s a winner.

I used &quot;Knox&quot; gelatin powder and in the directions it just said to be combined with 2 cups liquid.  The first time I used 1/4 cup water to soak the powder, then added boiling 100 ml water and then the cool 150 ml of vinegar.  This never developed soft peaks or even soft set in the refrigerator over night, so threw it out and started over.  This time I used 1/4 of cool water to soak the heaping 1/2 tsp of gelatin powder, then adding the remaining water and the 150 ml of vinegar (which were boiling) to the soaked mixture.  I whipped for a long time with my KitchenAid mixer on high and, again, no soft peaks.  I decided to just refrigerate it over night and check it in the morning.  Yeah!!!  It worked and was thickened!!  I then used my mandolin and mini fryer for the chips and re-whipped the vinegar with great results.  The only change I made was to used malt vinegar (personal preference - not so sweet) and used Himalayan sea salt.
