Because I used a baking stone instead of a cookie sheet, I could not chill the stone between batches (that would take forever).  I used parchment paper on a chilled cutting board to portion the batches out.  I allowed the stone to cool for 2-3 minutes between batches while the previous batch of cookies cooled on their parchment sheet on the counter before I removed them to a cooling rack.

The dough was easy to handle and the recipe was simple enough. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter which I think amped up the flavor. I will say I DONT think the full 2 3/4 cups of flour is necessary. I used the full amount and the cookies tasted flour-y and were soft but inherently dry. I ended up adding about another 1/4 cup of butter to the batter to combat the dryness from the flour. I would recommend using premixed Cinnamon/Sugar (which is in the herbs and spices isle at the grocery) for convenience. These cookies are FLUFFY soft....and stayed that way all through out the night. They remind me of the Snickerdoodles from the Classic American Cookie store in the mall. I prefer my cookies to have a bit of crunch on the outside, but for someone who likes cookies that are soft.

I did feel that even though I cut the recipe in half there was a bit too much flour so I would prob cut down on it a tad bit. Oh I also followed some others and put in a 1tsp of vanilla and after rolling it in the sugar/cinnamon I put it in back in the freezer for about 5 min or so.

What I chose to do was to put the sticks of butter (2) in the microwave for about 20 seconds to soften them, this helped them mix easier. I mixed the ingredients using a KitchenAid mixer with the whisk attachment. I used a tablespoon measuring scoop to portion my cookies. I scooped them, rolled them in a ball, and them rolled them in a plate that had the cinnamon sugar mixture and then flattened them a bit, very delicately, so they would be better shaped. Baked for exactly ten minutes and perfection! Using the tablespoon measuring scoop yielded about 45-50 cookies. All delicious!  <br/>If you want very light tasting cookies and have the KitchenAid mixer, mix the butter, eggs, and sugar for about five minutes. Doing this adds air and makes it almost whipped.

I chill the dough for at least an hour covered in the fridge, if you don&#039;t chill the dough enough they will not come out right. I use cookie sheets that have an air pocket in them and lined with parchment paper for even baking. In my oven they need about 12 minutes with the pans being rotated halfway through baking. The cookies look underdone when you take them out, let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack. They will be perfectly soft days later, if they last that long."},{"name":"frosted pumpkin cookies","steps":"heat oven to 350f degrees', 'mix brown sugar , butter , and shortening in large bowl', 'stir in pumpkin and egg', 'stir in flour , baking powder , salt and cinnamon', 'stir in pumpkin seeds', 'drop dough by rounded tablespoons about 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheet', 'flatten slightly', 'bake 12-15 minutes or until almost no indentation remains when touched in the center', 'remove from cookie sheet', 'cool completely on wire rack', 'frost cookies with cinnamon frosting', 'sprinkle with additional chopped pumpkin seeds', 'cinnamon frosting: mix all ingredients until smooth and spreadable'","description":"this is a great fall recipe. i usually make it around october/november as a holiday treat. i get requests each year to make them for friends. i found it in a newstand magazine called cookies from the heart by gold medal/betty crocker.","ingredients":"brown sugar', 'butter', 'shortening', 'canned pumpkin', 'egg', 'gold medal all-purpose flour', 'baking powder', 'salt', 'ground cinnamon', 'pumpkin seeds', 'powdered sugar', 'milk'","review":"Perfect texture and flavor.

So, just keep an eye on them making sure they don&#039;t burn and are fully done. The recipe is easy to follow and simple to make. In addition to taking little ingredients. Though cream of tartar can be expensive. I didn&#039;t chill the baking sheet and cookies, and they turned out fine as well. These are great cookies and very easy to make.

The second time I added a tablespoon of vanilla and instead of using 1 and 1/2 cups regular sugar, I used 1 cup and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar - I also replaced the regular sugar with brown sugar added with the cinnamon. Again, I didn&#039;t have cream of tartar...or lemon, or baking powder, or white wine vinegar (all of the things the\\nweb says can be substituted for cream of tartar), so I didn&#039;t add any baking soda (since the cream of tartar is intended to react with the baking soda and make the texture of the cookie).

I didn't have all-purpose flour all I had was whole wheat flour but for every cup of all purpose flour I just used 3/4 of whole wheat flour. I also didn't have enough sugar to mix with the cinnamon for the coating so I had to use confectioners sugar. When I tried the dough it did not taste good (probably because of the flour I used) and it was extremely sticky (it was the first time I made snicker doodle cookies) and I was very wary but after almost tripling the amount of sugar I was supposed to mix with the cinnamon (since powdered sugar is really dense and not as sweet) I decided to just put in the first batch and if they sucked it would have been my own fault. I put the first batch in the oven just to see if I should even put in the effort to continue onwards. When I took them out they were darker then the pictures (I used brown sugar instead of white and the flour was a light brown color also) but they were exceptional. My grandma at 90 who despises sweets, tried to talk me into giving her more cookies. My little cousins who were there were in love along with everyone else who tried the cookies.

These things iz good!! It is a simple drop dough that comes together really fast, and bakes off just as easily. I made a double batch of the dough right before I went to bed, and portioned out a couple dozen balls with a #40 (3/4 oz.) Portion scoop. The next morning, I preheated the oven while showering. I was able to bake off 2 dozen cookies and get them cool enough for my wife to take to work, and still had time to sit down and drink a full cup of coffee. Total morning time invested? An hour!! I didn't run across any of the problems I read about in the reviews, though I did change the creaming method just a bit. First, I took the butter and clarified it on the stovetop till I had a nice brown butter. It makes the cookies even better, I think! Anyway, I creamed the cooled down butter with the sugar, salt, and 1 Tbsp of bourbon vanilla extract per batch. Using a hand mixer, I creamed the mixture on high speed for 1 minute. Using COLD eggs, I mixed them in one at a time on low speeds till just incorporated. I did it this way because I wanted to limit the amount of air that got mixed in during the creaming process, and using cold eggs sets the butter back up faster, which stops the emulsification of egg yolk and fat. This is key if you want those cookies that you had when you were a kid! At this point, I took the dry ingredients and sifted them into the creamed mixture all at once. I folded it all together with a wooden spoon till it just comes together. I only use this method with these cookies and a shortbread recipe my grandmother gave me. I used whole wheat pastry flour which weighs 4 1/2 oz. per cup. A.P. flour weighs a little more and bread flour a little more again. Sugar weighs 8 oz. per cup, 1 pound per pint. I did use the baking soda, though!! But rather than go buy creme of tartar for this and maybe an Italian merengue or two, I used what I had. Apple cider vinegar! It took me a couple times making them to get it right. It seems to work at 1 Tbsp per batch. For those who like a bit fluffier, chewy cookie, you can add 2 tsp cornstarch. This helps prevent some of the collapse when they cool and helps the outside with the crispness! Using a 3/4 oz. portion scoop, I got 51 cookies out of a double batch. I don't press them down, I just roll em and place on a parchment paper lined sheet pan. Bake for 11 minutes and check. The edges should start to brown slightly. If they aren't yet, another minute always finishes them off for me. I store the doughballs in the freezer for up to a month. After that the baking soda can start degrading. On a whim, I sprinkled the sugar mixture in the bottom of a small pyrex baking dish. I took the dough and pressed a cookie &quot;shell&quot; in the bottom of it and halfway up the side. Cover and place in the fridge to chill. I made a filling out of apples, a little fresh oj, and some of its zest, some brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom, and some sultana raisins lightly pickled in champagne vinegar and honey. I sauteed this for about 8 minutes or so, until I could add some roux and a bit of cornstarch slurry, and it was really, really thick. As it bakes it will release more moisture, which will thin it out somewhat. I put the COLD filling in the pyrex and put one cookie ball for every serving in the dish on top. I sprinkle liberally with sugar mixture and put in a 350&ordm;F. oven, on the middle shelf. I set a timer for 15 minutes and checked it. I moved it to the top shelf because the bottom cookie was cooking a bit faster than the top. It was done at the 20 minute mark. Snickerdoodle apple cobbler.

Here are some extra precautions you can take to make sure they turn out right. 1. Make sure your butter and eggs are at room temperature before you start. 2. REALLY cream the butter and sugar together before you add the vanilla and eggs. It should have a light, almost whipped, consistency and only a little granulation left. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well between eggs. Add vanilla to the butter/sugar/egg mixture and mix well again. 3. When you add the flour/dry mixture to the wet, mix until JUST combined. Do not over-mix at this step. 4. Chill dough in the fridge for at least an hour before baking. If you're in a hurry, you can chill for 10-15 minutes, then roll the dough into one inch balls, coat in the cinnamon-sugar mixture, and then chill again in the fridge for 15-20 minutes. 5. Use silicone baking mats if you have them. If not, double up on the baking sheets/pans. This will help the bottoms not brown too quickly. Either way, cool baking sheets in the fridge for 10-15 minutes right before adding the cookie dough balls, flattening just a little bit with your palm, and baking. 6. Recipe says bake at 350 degrees which is ok if you're SURE your oven doesn't run hot. If when you bake cookies the bottoms sometimes come out too dark, bake at 325 instead. 7. Cookie bottoms should be just barely browned but the edges should be firm when you remove them from the oven."},{"name":"frozen chocolate dessert","steps":"bring corn syrup and water to a boil', 'remove from heat and stir in chocolate chips and vanilla', 'cool', 'break up chocolate wafers with your fingers and pulverize in the blender', 'melt butter and mix well with the crushed wafers in a small bowl', 'press into an 8 pie plate', 'with an electric mixer , beat cream until stiff', 'add condensed milk and cooled chocolate mixture', 'beat mixture until stiff', 'stir in nuts with a rubber spatula', 'pour into prepared pie shell', 'freeze'","description":"such a simple name for such a fabulous dessert. i got this recipe from the cook at a conference center near seattle where i had been attending a meeting. this is a bona fide winner.","ingredients":"butter', 'chocolate wafers', 'light corn syrup', 'water', 'vanilla', 'semi-sweet chocolate chips', 'condensed milk', 'whipping cream', 'walnuts'","review":"Delicious!

Anyway, my family ended up eating every single cookie (I brought about 20 cookies but the recipe made about 48 and I kept the rest, doing the opposite of being thankful on such a day and hoarding the majority for myself without guilt).

The one inch ball slightly smashed resulted in perfect cookies. 3) Instructions should indicate how far apart to place cookies on the sheet, 3-4 inches apart is sufficient. 4) Chilled the dough for 30 minutes in a metal bowl prior to working with it. 5) Used parchment paper on the cookie sheet, cookies released easily."},{"name":"frozen fruit and veggie smoothie","steps":"using an immersion blender , or regular blender , blend frozen fruits , banana , and ice until smooth', 'add in spinach a little at a time , blending thoroughly after each addition', 'sweeten to taste', 'serve immediately'","description":"a delish and easy way to get fruit and veggie nutrition.  it would be a great breakfast or snack.  i have no idea why it says the calories on this are over 10k.","ingredients":"ice', 'banana', 'watermelon', 'berries', 'baby spinach', 'honey', 'artificial sweetener'","review":"They came out great!

I also used only 1 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I removed from the oven after 8 minutes to get a softer cookie.  (Cooled on a wire rack.)  Even with the more hardy bran flakes, the cereal gives a chewy, rather than a crunch texture.  It tastes almost like they have coconut in them, but without the coconut aftertaste.  I think they are a little too sweet and a little short on flavor.  If I make them again, I will cut back on the sugar overall and maybe substitute maple syrup for part of the sugar.

In order to replicate that first experience, I used half the amount of ground beef (500g), and doubled the spices stipulated in this recipe. I also added 1 teaspoon of salt to the spices. I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used a good few shakes of cayenne instead. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used 1 x 400g can of chopped tomatoes and 155g (5oz) of peas. This done, the result was exactly the same as the authentic Korean Keema I had tasted before, and it made 500g of mince stretch to four generous serves. Served with steamed jasmine rice, this made a wonderful, light, casual lunch and I was able to freeze the leftovers for another day. Although chia says the lemon juice sprinkled over the top is optional, to me it's an integral part of the dish and I wouldn't leave it out. This is also nice with some chopped coriander (cilantro) over the top which was a nice addition, but it's not essential.

I used about 1.35 lb of veal and doubled all of the spices as kookabura suggested as well as added a teaspoon of salt as all other reviewers suggested.  Despite these modifications, I still found it to be a little bland when I went to eat it.  However, I then followed mianbao's suggestions and put hot curry powder over it and a significant amount of salt and pepper and found it to be a lot more to my liking.  I was wondering if the veal might have muted the flavor and if lamb or beef would have been better?  I also definitely agreed with the other reviewers that the lemon juice is a must.

I think some of the revews here about too much salt might be because some turkey processors put juices in with the meat which may have salt.  I used 1 teaspoon of salt in my mixture and it was just right, so you may want to cook up a teaspoon of your ground turkey before adding the spices.  I mashed my turkey with the spices and let it sit in the fridge overnight and it was perfectly seasoned. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of smoked paprika and 1 tablespoon of good olive oil to the mix, and for the fennel seeds I ground thoes in a pepper mill so that there wouldnt be hard bits in the sausage.  I think next time I will leave out the cloves (personal preference).  I think the little bit of olive oil helped to keep he meat moist (it was not oily at all) and it helped to develop the flavors from the herbs & spices as some of them are not water soluable.  Next time I will add some parsley just because I think it sounds good :)  Thanks again for an outstanding recipe!!!"},{"name":"fruit cocktail cookies","steps":"mix shortening , sugar and eggs', 'add fruit cocktail , vanilla , raisins and nuts', 'mix in flour , baking soda , baking powder , spices and salt', 'drop by teaspoons onto greased baking sheet', 'bake 11-12 minutes at 400f', 'cool', 'mix powdered sugar and butter with enough of the saved juice to make a thin icing', 'frost when cool'","description":"it's a recipe from my neighbor. her kids love them. i was intrigued by the ingredients.","ingredients":"shortening', 'brown sugar', 'eggs', 'fruit cocktail', 'vanilla', 'raisins', 'nuts', 'flour', 'baking soda', 'baking powder', 'cinnamon', 'clove', 'ginger', 'allspice', 'salt', 'butter', 'powdered sugar'","review":"I made these for breakfast at the last minute with turkey breast\\nI had just ground up.\\nI didn't have any white pepper or\\ncayenne, so I skipped both.\\nThe sausage was very tasty even with mixing and using immediately.\\nThe salt amount was just right.\\nWill add some olive oil in the next batch, because with straight ground turkey breast it was bit on the dry side.

I let the turkey sit overnight this time.  It didn't seem so hot-spicy... but we found the spices to be overwhelming as we ate our breakfast.

There are so many spices that it totally dominates the flavor to the point that you cant even taste the natural taste of the turkey and I added an extra 3/4 of a pound of ground turkey to try to balance it out. Third, when you point this large a quantity of spices in something, it starts to get a gritty dry texture to it, rather than the juicy moist texture you want in a sausage. Also, the ground cloves are out of place in this sausage and make it taste more like a curry. There is also way too much ground clove in this! I&#039;ve had curry dishes that used far less ground clove, so what you end up is a sausage that tastes more like a bad curry. Another thing is the amount of pepper. OMG! Way too much pepper and then it calls for a little cayenne on top of that! I would say if you think you will like the flavor of this sausage, cut all of the spices in half.

I substituted 2/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour (this is the substitution ratio that I have found works best for me) and used dried cranberries rather than raisins and walnuts for the nuts.  It's not a terribly sweet bread, so next time I might add some more fruit bits because they add a nice sweetness to the bread.  The bread is so dense and moist it is almost textured like a fine cake, but definitely much healthier!  It rose well and is a really pretty loaf.  Despite the whole grains, it is not dry, too dense or crumbly at all.
