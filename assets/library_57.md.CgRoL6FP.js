We have long avoided P.F.Chang's outlets because the food, while tasty is salt and sugar laden.  This recipe is no different.  The 2433 mg of NaCl is nuts.  However, we liked the basic mix.  <br/><br/>We went with the basic flavoring of the fillets--dark sesame oil, smashed fresh ginger and chopped scallion tops.  However, we reduced the amount of the oil, finding the 1 tsp per fillet recommended by the submitter excessive.  Instead, we increased the ginger and applied the oil with a pastry brush until it was covered and then, let it sit until it had had a chance to be absorbed.  We then wrapped the fillets in wax paper and steamed them for eight minutes in a traditional bamboo steamer, which we placed in our wok.<br/><br/>The vegetable medley was very good, however, we eliminated the tomatoes because they are hardly Asian, and instead we used a mixture of fresh oyster, shiitake and cremini mushrooms to broaden the taste.  These we soaked in filtered water for one half hour to better hydrate them before we sliced them.  <br/><br/>We modified the sauce with low sodium Kikoman soy sauce, very low sodium organic chicken broth and 1 teaspoon of organic light brown sugar.  We reasoned we could always increase the saltiness according to taste.  We, instead brought up the sweetness and complexity by adding some additional shredded fresh ginger and two or three splashes of Thai sweet chili sauce.  <br/><br/>The finished meal is very pretty, especially because we kept the bok choy and scallions recognizable by cutting them minimally.  The pallette impression is very good (much better than anything the Chan corporate kitchen ever produced).

He loved it and raved about the dish having eaten it both on day one and for leftovers. The other family members gave it mixed reviews. Their main complaint being it was too spicy. I used a Mexican enchilada sauce that had kick when mixed with the green chilies. The sauce makes a big difference as do choosing mild or medium chiles. The tortillas fell apart when I filled after dipping in sauce, so I instead put sauce on the bottom of the pan then filled the oil dipped tortillas then covered with more sauce, cheese etc. Be aware this recipe uses a lot of dishes, lots of space and a good bit of time.

Take your baking pan out as soon as the butter is melted or it will burn. Pour your Jiffy mix into the melted butter and bake in oven as usual.

I got 2.5 pounds and it was still too much.  Three apples would have sufficed.  After putting half of the batter in and putting as many apples as would fit (still not even half of what I had), there was not really enough batter to cover up the apples for the next layer.
