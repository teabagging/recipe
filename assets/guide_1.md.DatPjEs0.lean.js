Because the recipe description suggested the preparation was &quot;thick, greasy, salty,&quot; I cut the seasoning salt and garlic salt in half. Did not want salty-tasting meat. The result was great - and it may not have mattered either way. I may just use the full salt amount next time and judge any difference. Also, rinsing the meat as suggested is great for cutting down the grease (never did that before), and I used lean ground meat to begin with.

Even though we like food to be spicy, the next time I will cut the sriracha in half, and I may also try adding a teaspoon or so of hoisen to give the sauce a little more body.  It is because of these changes that I gave it four stars instead of five, so this is a very repectable recipe.  I also added a good sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds (now offered by McCormick), and they were an attractive and tasty addition.  As to preparation, when I do wings with our own BBQ/hot sauce, I bake them until just done (skin lightly crispy), then toss them in sauce, chill overnight when possible, then grill to give the outside a nice finish.

I altered the recipe a bit to make it more like an actual meatball recipe.  The most helpful thing you can do is to grind up the walnuts in a food processor.  Otherwise, your meatballs have a little too much crunch in them to pass for meat.  Once you do that, take out a 1/4 cup of the cheddar cheese, and replace it with parmesan cheese.  It also helps to add basil, oregano, parsley, garlic, and a little salt and pepper.  Make you sure you keep turning the meatballs every few minutes as you brown them in the oven, or they will burn.  Then, when finished browning, instead of pouring vegetable broth over them, throw them right into your pot of pasta sauce to finish cooking.  These will look and taste like real meatballs.

During the initial baking stage, make sure to turn every 5-10 minutes or they will stick and burn.  Once they had cooked for 20 minutes I covered them in marinara sauce to bake for an hour.  There are so many variations on how to make and use them (read other peoples' reviews like I did for ideas).  These are going into my regular rotation.

Sorry I'm just reviewing them. Made these the first time for my newly vegetarian daughter who absolutely loved the sweet and sour cocktail meatballs which have been a tradition in our family for many years.So I whipped up the meatballs(no broth packet) and dropped them into simmering sauce. Cooked them at a simmer for about 30 minutes, then transferred to a crock pot set on warm. Also made a larger crockpot full of the original recipe. Our Italian guests sampled both and continued to return to the vegetarian ones. Even after I explained what they were and how  they were made, they kept eating these ones. Second time I made a recipe of Mean Chef's mushroom gravy with veggie broth and also just dropped the uncooked meatballs into the gravy, and simmered away. Served over mashed potatoes just like Swedish meatballs. Think this just goes to show how versatile and great this recipe is."},{"name":"curried crab asparagus cheesy tofu dip","steps":"saute onion and diced garlic', 'when colored , add 1 / 8 tsp curry powder', 'saute to incorporate', 'add asparagus , crab meat , and 1 / 8 tsp more curry', 'saute to mix', 'dump into a mixing bowl and let cool a bit', 'meanwhile , preheat oven to 350f', 'blend tofu and 1 / 4 tsp curry until creamy and mixed', 'add to veggie mixture and mix', 'add mozzarella cheese and mix', 'spread evenly in a small baking dish', 'sprinkle with cayenne , parm , and breadcrumbs', 'bake , uncovered , for 20 minutes', 'serve with pita chips , veggies , or as a bread spread'","description":"you just can't stop eating this! think of it as crab-artichoke dip, but with asparagus in place. the asparagus adds texture and color where artichokes get mushy and lost in the dip. i could eat the entire recipe as a meal. it may not make much, but it's worth it! leftovers can be reheated the same way. rsc4","ingredients":"onion', 'garlic', 'curry powder', 'asparagus spears', 'tofu', 'imitation crabmeat', 'fat free mozzarella cheese', 'cayenne pepper', 'parmesan cheese', 'toasted breadcrumb'","review":"Thank you! I am a lifelong vegetarian born to hippy parents.  My mother always made a similar recipe growing up but it had been so long, she didn't quite remember the measurements.  I did make some alterations but this was as close to mom's meatless meatballs as I've found.  I had a small eggplant on hand so I sauted it in some fresh garlic and oil, chopped, and added it to the mixture. I also halved the cheddar and added freshly crumbled romano cheese.  The eggplant made the ingredients a little too moist so I added some more bread crumbs.  I also left out the soup packet but used my own seasonings (I didn't add any additional salt). I had to bake them a little longer (again because of the eggplant) to brown.  I put them in tomato sauce on the stove and let them cook for an hour.  When they were all done, I was hesitant to eat it because it looked so much like a real meatball (I thought someone did a switcheroo on me).  Made a meatball sandwich for my carnivore hubby and he was amazed when I told him there was no meat in it.  He kept starring at the sandwich in amazement.

I freeze them and then just take out a few (4-5)to put in the oven with broth in small custard dish (covered) when I make her spaghetti.

I omit the Lipton's and use vegetarian chicken consomme powder- about 3 teaspoons is enough to replace the onion soup mix, and then I add onion powder and garlic powder.  Anything more would be way too salty.  Haven't gotten to step 5 yet- my picky 5 yo loves them warmed up (from the freezer) as is.  Not sure I could handle them being saltier from more broth. My meat-eating husband likes them, too.  **UPDATE**  My picky 5 year old is now 9, and she still loves these, though we definitely do the broth step these days.  I use different nuts (never walnuts) like almonds, pecans, or a mix.  I use a mix of reduced fat and regular sharp cheddar, and I pulse 4 pieces of light whole wheat bread into crumbs.  Still using the chicken consomme for the broth and these are fabulous.  I don't add any soup mix to the meatballs-  just onion and garlic powder.

My family really likes potatoes and green peppers off the grill. We do ours slightly different. When we make them we mix chunked potatoes, onions, and green pepper.

I tried adding the bacon & cheese this time. I used a regular onion. I also seasoned the potato mix with the salt, pepper, plus garlic & onion powder. I dotted the potato mix with margarine. I did have to grill these in a foil packet as my new Colemen portable grill is not got alot of head space.

We moved from Cincinnati to Kansas a few years ago and this is an incredible recipe. VERY similar to Skyline. My husband and 11-year-old daughter were impressed and my husband actually thought this was better than Skyline! The only change that I would insist on is not to add onions to the chili. Real Cincinnati chili doesn't have chopped onions in the chili but they are put raw on top of the chili at serving time along with cheese, etc. I used a little onion powder instead instead of chopped onions and it was great. I also added a little more salt (1/2 to 1 tsp.) and used a pressure cooker (for 1/2 an hour) to cook it faster since the family was hungry and couldn't wait 2-3 hours.

Although It's totally unlike the many Tex-Mex chilis with which I am familiar (CIncinnati Chili is more like a meat sauce than a stew), me and the other NY'ers who had never had CC all adored it -- especially the three- and four- and five-way versions. It was fun listening to people try to guess the spices as they tasted it.BUT I happened to serve two Cincinnatians and they thought this was superb!

I use cinnamon sticks in the ubiquitous Vietnamese noodles, pho. Cinnamon powder is put in a cloth spice bag and discard when done. So I put in 2 2&quot; cinnamon sticks and 1 T of whole cloves in a spice bag. You can wrap the cloves in a coffee filter, wrap completely and tie in kitchen twine. Since I grind my own beef, I simply slide the freshly ground meat into the boiling water, stir with a wooden spoon. Or like someone suggested, use the stick blender to break up the meat. I skipped the onion since quite a few folks from Cincinnati said onion is a &quot;way&quot;, not in the chili itself. I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of raw cacao powder and 1/2 T of butter instead of the 1/2 oz. unsweetened chocolate. I used the same measurement for the rest of the ingredients. Once done, discard the clove bag and cinnamon sticks. My husband loved it with raw chopped onion and shredded cheddar cheese.

It was too tough for me cooking as directed.So the second batch I made again as it, however, I cooked the cube as directed and then added 1/2 cup beef broth and simmered for 15 minutes or so as I fed the cats and watered the plants.  It made all the difference. I then finished them in the oven as instructed. Just that little bit to tenderize the steak made them tender and not dry.Finished it with the swiss cheese or gruyere is what I had ... same thing and I did have 1/4 red and 1/4 green pepper, but that changed nothing.It was very good. I'll give it five stars because it was easy and simple with great flavor.

A few days ago, my family and I visited a local farm to do some apple picking. I thought that if ever there were a time to make a nice batch of cider, this was it. This particular recipe seemed to be fairly simple so I thought I would give it a whirl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GOOD: It&#039;s delicious. It really is. The apples are key here. Freshly picked golden and red delicious apples made for a naturally sweet and delicious beverage. Loved what the allspice brought to the table. Can&#039;t say enough about how tasty this turned out to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE BAD: This was without a doubt the most tedious and time consuming recipe I have ever attempted. Appears simple, but wait until you get to the filtering! Three total hours of cooking and about two hours of squeezing apples though cheesecloth as well as double filtering through a fine strainer. And for what? Perhaps a tad more than a quarter of a gallon of cider. I started with ten apples and what must have been about three quarters of a gallon of filtered water. I&#039;m not an idiot. I understand that a fair amount of the liquid will evaporate via the boiling process and of course there will be plenty of liquid that you just won&#039;t be able to squeeze out of those juice-logged apples. But I expected to get AT LEAST a half gallon of cider out of this recipe. Bare minimum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conservative estimate on this project would be around $18 ($8 for the ten apples, $4 for the 4 cinnamon sticks, $2 for the 3 tbsp allspice and $4 for the cheesecloth). That&#039;s $18 for around five hours of work and a quarter gallon of cider. I don&#039;t care how delicious this turned out. I can&#039;t justify giving more than two stars for a recipe that takes this long, costs this much and gives me this little in return. And quite frankly, two stars is very generous. Taste alone bumps it up one star. It is that good. Too bad it&#039;s not worth the effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I won&#039;t be attempting this method again."},{"name":"curry naan grilled chicken sandwich","steps":"put garlic , shallot and cilantro in food processor , chop all', 'add butter and salt , process well to mix well', 'preheat oven 350 ? f , spread garlic herb butter on naan then toast lightly', 'cut on half', 'season chicken with salt and pepper then grill , bake bacon to be crisp', 'heat medium sauce pan , stir simply mushed potatoes and milk until smooth', 'spoon over cumin and alfredo sauce and seasoning salt and pepper mixture', 'bake until edges are bubbly', 'place swiss cheese , tomato sauce , sliced avocado , chicken , mushed potato , american cheese and bacon on naan then bake in the oven 3-4 minutes until cheese is melt', 'place another half piece of naan on it , put on serving plate'","description":"ready, set, cook! special edition contest entry: this is nice grilled sandwich!","ingredients":"naan bread', 'chicken thighs', 'simply potatoes traditional mashed potatoes', 'milk', 'alfredo sauce', 'cumin', 'avocados', 'swiss cheese', 'american cheese', 'tomato sauce', 'bacon', 'garlic', 'shallots', 'cilantro', 'butter', 'salt'","review":"This recipe doesn&#039;t really need any sugar.

I used 8 big red delicious (I just bought them in bulk at Costco cause why not), and quartered them, covering them with boiling water. It made, in total, a half gallon full and a quart. So this recipe will deliver quantity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another important thing to do is to keep adding water during the first hour of boil and the two hours of simmer. I add water around every tenth minute during the boil, and about twice during the simmer. This keeps the volume up, and if you give it enough time during the cooking, doesn&#039;t dilute the flavor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All in all, great recipe, and totally customizable.

I had some fresh strawberries, so I cooked up the pint basket of strawberries with 6 pkts. of splenda, then added a little cornstarch in after cooked, to thicken. I let them cool while I made the filling and batter. I loved the taste of the cream cheese mixture. Went very well with the strawberry filling. The muffins were a different story. I creamed the egg, milk, brown sugar, zest and vanilla. However, when I mixed it in with the flour mixture, I used my hand mixer. BIG MISTAKE! The muffins came out flat on top, and very heavy texture. I used a 6 muffin tin, and they made huge muffins. The only thing I really noticed when I bit into them was that there was WAY too much baking powder. I wouldn't use any more than 2 tsp. next time at the most.  It's all I could taste in the batter part of the muffin. I will definately play around with this recipe, but I will also make them again and mix by hand, and see if it makes a difference. When biting into a piece with mostly cream cheese and strawberry filling it was fantastic, so I know this recipe has potential. Thanks for sharing Redsie!

I also used 1/8 flax 1/8 chia as I was low on the flax, and blended all dry ingredients in the blender first.
