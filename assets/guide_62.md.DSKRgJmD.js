This created the creamy cheese mixture.  By using a &quot;Cheese Whiz&quot; or Velveeta type cheese, you are eliminating the need, and flavor, of the Bass Ale, as it would be too runny.

Good parts:  flavor is delightful, especially just that hint of thyme I've never found in a lasagne before; I also enjoyed the balance of meat and cheese with noodles.  I did add some extra sauce for personal preference and b/c I didn't cook the noodles first (more on that in a sec).  I love that the list of ingredients is so simple and the results so tastey.  The only things I didn't like were that the recipe didn't mention whether or not to cook the noodles, and the layering directions aren't completetly clear. I understand that through simple math (beginning with 12 noodles, there are only so many layers one can produce at 3 noodles per layer) but the proportions that go into the layers are merely implied rather than expressly laid out. I didn't cook my noodles, but after looking through the ingredients added extra spaghetti sauce (for a total of 30 ounces) and 1/2 a cup of water around the edges.  By the time it was done cooking, the top noodles were just a bit chewy, but when I came back to it later in the night it had set up perfectly with no chewy noodles.  I froze this in 24 portions for very easy lunches and it freezes and thaws very well.  I would make a meat sauce to go with this (after all, if we're being Irish about it, there's no such thing as too much cow on the plate) if serving it to my family.  It goes very well with the standard lasagne sides: garlic bread or bruschetta, green salad, and some other fresh veggie.

My husband and I really enjoyed this pie. For this recipe, I used a Diet Sierra Mist, but the next time I make this, I'm going to make it w/a diet strawberry soda (just to see how it tastes). A few things I wanted to mention here....when cooking the cornstarch w/the diet soda, I cooked it over a medium (to medium-high heat) for about 5 minutes, and after adding the jell-o, I noticed the jell-o didn't dissolve very well, so then I cooked it over medium heat for a couple minutes;  stirring it continuously.  And after adding the strawberries, (and carefully stirring the fruit for a minute or two) I let the strawberries set in the pan for a few minutes, before adding them to the pie shell. This helped to cool the berries down a bit. I chilled the pie in the fridge for 3 hrs & 30 mins. One other thing I wanted to mention....after a couple days in the fridge, I did notice that the graham cracker crust does softened up a lot.

The whole chicken table presentation was good and the gravy was tasty. I served it with mashed potatoes along with buttered green peas.  I've prepared this chicken twice: This rating is based upon having followed the recipe precisely the first time. What I learned after the first time is that with all of the butter and oil on its skin, especially after basting per the recipe directions, and being roasted at 400 degrees, the chicken became too brown, too soon. Also, on my first attempt, I found that the amount of cornstarch suggested for the gravy, even with the  add on provision was insufficient. The gravy, even with the additional cornstarch, was difficult to prepare because it was almost impossible to eliminate the cornstarch particles. Having said this, my first attempt at this recipe produced a very good dinner and I became interested in trying to improve it. So, the second time I used this recipe, I did a few things differently and I had a rewarding result:  \\nFirst, after the initial 25 minute stay in the 400 degree oven before basting the first time, I reduced the oven heat to 375 degrees for the duration of the cook time.  Second, I used \\nWondra Sauce and Gravy Flour, rather than cornstarch. to thicken and prepare the gravy.  In my experience Wondra Sauce Flour is the best, and it certainly was in my second attempt at improving this roasted chicken recipe. So, my recommendation for a perfectly prepared Roasted Chicken and Gravy recipe, with respect to the author, is this:\\nAfter following instructions and basting after 25 minutes, reduce your oven temperature to 375.

The prep time for me wasn't the 10 minutes listed, but 45 minutes.  Then, there was the cleanup of about 15 minutes.  So I would not rate this as 'easy' (under 30 minuts) per-se.  I think next time I will thaw the frozen veggies in the microwave instead and that will cut out at least 2 pans.  Will I make this again....you bet!  It would be a great freeze-ahead recipe as well as a good dish to impress company.  P.S. My kids loved it too!"},{"name":"low fat oven fried chicken","steps":"spray 9x13 baking dish with cooking spray', 'in pie plate , combine panko crumbs , garlic powder , salt , pepper , red pepper and bouquet garnie', 'in another pie plate , beat egg whites slightly', 'lightly dust each chicken breast with flour , dip in egg white then in bread crumbs', 'place in baking dish', 'bake @350 25-30 minutes or till internal temperature reaches 165 degrees'","description":"i created this recipe when looking for a crispy oven fried chicken.  the bouquet garni gives it great flavor.  if you can't find it, use some rosemary, thyme and sage.","ingredients":"boneless skinless chicken breast', 'panko breadcrumbs', 'garlic powder', 'salt', 'black pepper', 'crushed red pepper flakes', 'bouquet garni', 'egg whites', 'flour'","review":"Soooo good!

FT, these are wonderful scones, and easy, too!  They have a much more tender crumb than the scones I normally make, probably due to creaming the sugar and butter, the addition of the egg, and the pumpkin - the texture is slightly reminicent of pumpkin pie - mmmm!  The honey butter is wonderful - having never made it before, I'm thrilled to have a simple, delicious spread to offer for morning treats!  I did add cinnamon chips and pecan to the scones, and as I didn't have mixed spice (can't find that in Canada), I used Pumpkin Pie Spice, which I understand is very similar.

So, I thought frantically what to do as I was determined to make this recipe. A look into the fridge offered the perfect solution: A parsnip thick and chunky. I ended up cooking it for 8 minutes and then mashing it.

I could tell from the gushing reviews that making as is would be wonderful, so I just had to mix it up a bit. Because a 15oz can of pumpkin is 425 grams, I essentially doubled the recipe so I didn't have half a can left over. I made these vegan by using margarine, almond milk and egg replacer. And as if that wasn't enough I replaced the sugar with Splenda and for half the flour I used whole wheat pastry flour. (250 grams of flour is just a little over 2 cups.) I used the spice mix link in the description and I made my own self-rising flour (1.25 t baking power + 1/8 t salt per cup of flour). But even with my drastic experimentation, the recipe held up really really well and is really really good!  The hardest part is following the directions at the end that say to wait 15 minutes before serving.

These were great little scones. Served them with my morning coffee last week and they were very satisfying. Instead of serving with honey butter (which sounds wonderful) I made them with turbinado sugar crusted tops so they would travel better to work. Americans should take care with the conversions here: I came up with 8.9oz pumpkin and 2 cups   2 Tbsp Recipe#5274 #5274 after visiting The Metric Kitchen website for conversions. Not the 1 to 1 ratio you would expect as they are both 250 grams in the ingredients list (the flour is much lighter weight). I will be making these again. Thanks, French Tart!
