However, when going to pre-cook the chicken I noticed I had Italian sausages in the fridge that needed using, so I made this with those rather than chicken as well as the change in pepper. I think the dish made with these two changes is 5* worthy, as the chili gave a nice kick and the sausage gave a great flavour, but I imagine the recipe as written would have been quite bland with only chicken, hence the 4* rating. Will definitely make this again with the sausage substitute the next time I have some that need using and feel like something different to the usual pasta dish I make with them.'"},{"name":"Fennel and Mushroom Soup\\"","rate":"4.307692528","url":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/720x405/995993.jpg","ingredients":"skinless boneless chicken breast halves olive oil butter lemon pepper bulb fennel trimmed and thinly sliced cream sherry sliced crimini mushrooms diced red bell pepper finely minced fresh parsley buttermilk half-and-half cream water chicken soup base","cooking":" Prep 10 m Cook 25 m Ready In 35 m Heat oil and butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
