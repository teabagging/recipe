I made this for my first lamb roast ever and i must add that i dont have much experience cooking. Cooking meat scares me but i decided to face that fear with this recipe. I used all the ingredients listed but also added fresh thyme chopped on top. With the suggestion of another reviewer, i added olive oil to the rub to make it easier to spread on the lamb leg. I also cooked it at 450 for 15 mins to brown and then the rest of the time at 350. Next time i would use a bit less salt but i did use coarse sea salt instead of normal salt.

I tried this last night and it was a big hit at a dinner.  One of my guests is a culinary school graduate so I knew I had a high bar to clear.  I made a few adaptations to the recipe as follows.  I made a spice rub (smoked paprika, garlic salt, brown sugar, salt, chili powder, black pepper, onion powder) and appied it to the beef the day before I cooked it.  I roasted the tenderloin in the oven at 275 degrees until it reached a temperature of 140 degrees.  This slow roasting method (a la Alton Brown) really sealed in the juices and kept the meat tender.  After the meat reached 140 degrees, I removed the tenderloin from the oven and rubbed it with an olive oil and herb combo and then pan seared it for 1-2 minutes each side.  I then let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting. When cutting it, the meat had the nice red color and was very juicy and tender. I put the bell pepper and mushroom mixture on the plate, put several slices of the tenderloin on top, and then poured over it a delicious cilantro-lime butter finishing sauce. I put the guacamole on top and then sprinkled tri-color tortilla strips on top.  I have included a picture. Voila!  Thanks for a great recipe!
