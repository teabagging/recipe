Recommend replacing the vinegar with either water or broth...you want to taste picadillo, not pickling juice. :( If you want to keep the seasonings, you might try adding some brown sugar.

I kept all of the veggies and other ingredients the same as I think Quinoa poofs up a bit more than the bulgar wheat. Plus I like lots of stuff in my salad. I eased up by just a bit on the olive oil and red wind vinegar but I don't think the whole amount would make much difference. Also, I used about 4 parts parsley to 1-2 parts mint which I got from my garden and is stronger than the stuff you buy in the store. I probably had at least a full 3/4 cup of parsley when chopped. To me, it is hard to determine how much one bunch is, so that's how I handled it. GREAT, GREAT recipe.

I substituted Quinoa in place of the bulgur, using 1 1/2 cups of dry Quinoa to 3 cups of water and cooking it according to the directions on its package. This made the perfect amount of Quinoa to veggie ratio since I prefer a more balanced salad. Any less Quinoa &amp; I think the parsley would have been too dominant. I used curly leaf parsley, which to me seemed to be just as flavorful as flat leaf but not as pungent. I chopped it very finely &amp; took other&#039;s advice &amp; measured 3/4 cup to 1 cup loosely packed. My &quot;1 bunch&quot; of green onions was 6 onions, &amp; I used the whole onion-- both the green &amp; the white. Where the recipe calls for 1 medium onion chopped, I only added 1/4 chopped to the salad, &amp; it was a little too strong even with such a small amount. So I suggest using a mild or sweet onion or leaving it out altogether; I thought the green onions gave it great flavor on their own. I used fresh garden mint as well &amp; only needed 1/4 cup or less after it was chopped. I used 16oz fresh cherry tomatoes quartered, &amp; kept the olive oil &amp; red wine vinegar as stated. Quinoa can be a little sticky so the oil really helped keep the texture of traditional tabbouleh. My only additions were 1 English cucumber finely chopped, which boosted the texture &amp; flavor immensely, &amp; about 2Tbls of balsamic vinegar to give the salad just a little bit of sweet without having to worry about granules of sugar showing up in the salad. I served this wonderful dish with hummus, pita bread, kalamata olives, &amp; marinated Greek chicken kabobs (recipe was from a different website). Everyone loved it all!!

I used Greek yoghurt instead of cream and removed 1/4 cup of the rice asparagus mixture so I could blend the soup in the pot with my stick blender - much easier. Realised after blending that the cream was supposed to go in last! Not a problem: I simply added a dollop of Greek yoghurt to each bowl. Delicious!

I had soooooo much liquid at the bottom of my bowl that most of the seasonings were lost in it.  Next time I will sprinkle the salt on the zucchini and let sit in a colander for about 10 minutes before squeezing and mixing.  I also dredged the individual fritters in cornmeal as well as what was in the mix.  Made them crispier.

The bake time was perfect for both sizes, surprisingly. They rose and fell some upon cooling like a cheesecake.  I topped some with cherry pie filling as suggested.

The dough was a snap to put together and the taste was delicious, not unlike that of marzipan.  The lemon zest was very faint and acted more to highlight the wonderful almond flavor.  Chilled as stated and began to make the cookies.  Things sort of went downhill for me after that. I wasn't really clear about the size  of dough needed to yield 48 cookies and used my scoop that measures 2 teaspoons, turned out the right amount was about half that as I only had 23 logs.  Unfortunately, I started rolling since the dough was getting soft quite quickly.  I had a very difficult time with the egg wash -- messy aside -- as I didn't find that it helped the almonds adhere any better than simply rolling the dough in the nuts directly.  Ended up doing 1 dozen each way to see if there was a difference in the final results and did not find one. Given my thrill with the dough, I was a little disappointed with the final cookie which was a bit tough and lost some of the nutty flavor. I think this recipe has absolutely fabulous potential and want to experiment a bit more, for example, all that mushing to get the nuts to stick may require the dough to re-chill to get better results.

I made 2 different styles; one type coated with a mixture of mini chocolate chips and plain toffee bits, and the other type coated with M&Ms.  The small size of the mini chips and toffee bits worked really well because they adhere so easily to the pretzels.  The M&M type were very colorful and would be great for kids.  I wanted to use the mini M&Ms but I couldn't find them in the stores.  I think they would have worked better and looked nicer than the large M&Ms.  The pretzels were fairly easy to cut in half; only a few didn't cut neatly.  (The ingredient should really be listed as pretzel rods instead of pretzels sticks.)  I made these by myself, but it would be quicker if 2 people were working together with one to dip the pretzels in caramel, and the other to dip them in the coating.  I had to stop and reheat the caramel often which would be lessened with 2 people.  Overall, a very fun (and tasty) project.

I intended to make Mock Chop Suey, but realized after the meat defrosted that I forgot to buy vegetables this week.  I still wanted a ground beef dish with rice and found this recipe.  I had no green peppers and had a headache so I didn't feel like chopping an onion.  I used onion flakes and pre-chopped garlic from a jar.  I browned the meat with the onion flakes and garlic.  After draining the fat, I added the water and soup, but I did not add soy sauce.  I started pouring before I realized that the bottle in my hand was worcesteshire and not soy sauce.  Doh!  So at that point I added pepper and salt (I wasn't going to use salt with the soy sauce).  Then I added the rice. Again, my headache impaired my judgment.  Take my advice: Follow the recipe and do NOT add the rice until after the mixture has simmered!  The rice soaked up the water too quickly and my dinner started to burn.  Luckily I caught it just in time before it was completely ruined.  I added more water and let it simmer until the rice was cooked.  I used only parmesan cheese - no Velveeta.  Despite all of my mistakes, it tasted really good!  And my headache was gone after I ate! Coincidence?  I look forward to making this again - correctly.

Be sure to spray the muffin tins with non-stick cooking spray first.  Since it wasn't noted I sprayed 6 cups & left 6 dry.
