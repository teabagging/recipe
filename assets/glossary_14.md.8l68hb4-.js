If anyone wants to try this recipe, I do have one piece of advice:  do NOT melt butter in the muffin cups and use that for the grease.  In order for the popovers to pop correctly and provide the light, airy volume, the grease in the cups must be spitting hot.  Butter cannot get hot enough without scorching (its smoke point is only 300 F.), and will not produce as good a result.  Vegetable oil spray, though, works fine.

This one stuck out. \\n\\nA few thoughts from a used to be slow food restaurant cook, who's rediscovered how fun it can be to cook at home in his 40's:\\n\\nIt's not slow. There's a fair amount of dedication to a recipe like this. It's not difficult, I'm just trying to pass on what I experienced - maybe it had something to do with the dark beer.\\n\\nWhen Rita says A very large pot she's not joking. 8Q or better to make the full recipe.\\n\\nThis is a monster recipe. It says 6Q, but my 6Q slow cooker was spewing when I finally got up - and in the rush to get it together and sleep, I left out the brown sugar, 1 can of diced tomatoes and a pound of ground chuck. \\n\\nWhen, yes when, I make this killer chili again, I'll whip it up in an 8Q stock pot on the stove top on a day off so I can keep the beast in line. Or, I'll halve the recipe and do it in the slow cooker. I'll leave out the brown sugar and add the other can of diced tomatoes.\\n\\nI'm a hearty eater and usually wish I'd made more so I could freeze some. Making the full recipe, we were able to bring some to work that day, share it with co-workers and freeze 5 Swedish Tupperware containers to boot.\\n\\nI started cooking this as my girlfriend headed off to work at 8am. She wasn't so sure I'd get anywhere close to edible food by the time she took a break at 4, but the finished reviews I got were immediate and impressive.\\n\\nWow! Just what I was looking for - a hearty meat and bean chili with the right amount of heat (I'd say medium), leftovers to freeze and an incredible odor of chili in the house.

Also, when I bake cookies I always use a heavy-duty 16-inch by 12-inch baking sheet, that way I never have to worry about my cookies baking into each other-I place 12 dough balls on each baking sheet. I also formed the cookie dough into balls, just a little under the size of a golf ball, actually about 3/4 the size. Their size may seem huge but the nuts and chips take up quite a bit of space.

I did re-bake it the next day, covered with foil, for another 20 minutes and that helped. Still, even with those problems, we loved the taste and the recipe is easy enough to put together.

I did take the advice of another review and used 1/2 lb of nuts which is an excellent ratio for the amount of syrup made. We prefer to have nuts in every bite, and there is still plenty of candy to sweeten the nuts and not make you think you are just biting into a clump of walnuts. I was a little hesitant in letting the candy cook without stirring it, but it was just fine! I would suggest this quick, easy recipe for the beginning candy maker, but they should definitely use a thermometer. It was simple and easy to follow! I would also suggest to start spooning it onto your cookie sheet as soon as you see the first sign of the syrup thickening, and that happens very quickly.

With temps varying from night-time lows of 4 degrees F to daytime highs of 22F, and lots of snow this past week, I knew I needed a chocolate fix that would last a few days as well as heat up the kitch. During these likely times in winter, provided we have electricity, I keep a box of store bought cake mix in the pantry. I cooked it last night, then began searching for chocolate syrups, frostings, and gravys that would make this a bit home-made. This recipe did the trick. Even with the cold temps I keep the main part of my house at during cold weather, this was way outta this world. It didn't solidify in the least. As a matter of fact, it kept the whole 9X13 poke cake fudgy and tasting of homemade even through a very cold kitchen night. I'm still eating on it, and it should last at least through tomorrow night's winter icey forcast. This was simple. I always have these ingredients at hand, and it turned a sheet cake into an unbelievably tasty delight. With the poke cake method, it becomes almost fudgy on the inside, but keeps most of the cake texture otherwise. This is a keeper, and will be used time and time again. I must say that for a moment I was concerned that the dry cocoa would not incorporate into the milk/sugar/etc., mixture, but right at the boiling point, all came together. In the end, it seeped into my cake beautifully, and it's scumpticious!

It was my first time making black lentils and I didn't know how much water to add as it wasn't listed here or on the lentil package...so I put them in a large pot and filled it 3/4 with water...which I think was too much as I had to cook it an extra 20 minutes to boil out the liquid.

I added 1 tablespoon each of curry, garam masala and chili powder. I had to add a lot of salt to try to bring out some flavor and it still was bland! Hmm. I ended up eating it with feta cheese and fresh cilantro wrapped in a flour tortilla and that was very good. The feta really improved it. For any other inquiring minds I researched black lentils briefly and found out they are in the mung bean family and are a firm lentil like the green ones but if you cook them like this they still will turn to mush (the package said 15-20 minutes).

The only difference in this recipe is that we have always used 2 packages of Kraft Old English Cheese Slices, softened and then diced very small. The Kraft Company recently changed the name a couple of years ago to Kraft Deli Deluxe Sharp Cheese Slices. It gives a better texture (not as soft) to the cheese ball. I also started mixing 1/4 of the walnuts and parsley mixture in with the cheese and then roll the cheese balls with the remaining walnut & parsley. We also give these as gifts along with a box of Sociables Crackers & a cheese knife.  The Sociables Crackers for some reason really go well with this cheese ball. I've tried others and nothing compares and everyone agrees. One more thing, I always double or sometimes triple the recipe during holiday's. Wrap in plastic wrap, then foil and put in the freezer (which keeps very well) It takes a couple of hours to de-thaw, which makes it perfect for spreading.
