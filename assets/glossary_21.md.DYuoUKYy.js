But the first batch did come out looking just like they did when they went in, only a tiny bit darker. They did hold together as balls when cooled. The second batch, I thought I'd add a sprinkle of water, and it helped, yet made the dough even stickier, which really adhered to my hands more than any dough I'd ever worked with (in the future, I'll use the spoon instead of my hands). I don't know if it was those extra droplets or if it was the chocolate chips, but these balls spread out like normal cookies, and some were spread out enough to break apart when cooled (no big deal). They were both delicious cookies. For ingredients, I used whole wheat pastry flour, ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ, and half dried raw cane juice and half white sugar, using the full amount (I like my cookies sweet).

I didn't bother with the caramel or blackcurrant sauce, but served the pears with some of the poaching liquor.  But the preparation for serving was stressful!  My first pear collapsed totally when I tried to remove its core after peeling it.  Subsequent pears were more successful, since I decided to core them before peeling, so they had a bit more structural stability.

I also added about 1/3 of a cup of a Greek Dry white Wine right after sauting the garlic and stirred enough to loosen the bits on the bottom of the pan before adding in the rest of the ingrediants. I think using a Greek wine is key here as they are more acidic than our Canadian wines.  I also pierced through the grape tomato's so the flavor of the tomatoes mixed with the sauce nicely.

These bottles were produced years and years ago, but no one wants to drink them.  They are regifted and regifted, going from house to house like an unwanted guest in search of a meal.  We were the receipients of such a bottle a few months ago, and are just too embarrassed to pass it on because we can't remember who gave it to us in the first place, and we're sure it's been to every single house in the community.  So it's been sitting in our wine cellar (actually, wine cabinet), gathering dust and it must be a very depressed bottle by now, watching other, more delicious and drinkable wines come and go with impunity.  But along comes French Tart and her Cava punch recipe to save the day, and this bottle's self-respect.  Okay, so it's not Spanish sparkling wine, it's Israeli fizzy stuff, and peach-flavored, which either adds panache or insult, we're not sure.  We chilled the bottle in the fridge overnight and the next morning mixed it with the orange juice and LOTS of Cointreau.  Not bad, not bad, in fact, it's very nice.  Now, I'm not that enamored with this drink that I am actually going to go out and buy another bottle of this fizzy stuff.  I'm going to have to wait until one of the three remaining bottles makes its way to our house as a hostess gift in the next year or so.

However, I was trying to find something different to fix for Thanksgiving dinner (we're a family of vegetarians). I found this recipe and read all of the reviews (yes, all 100 ), so, I thought I would give it a shot.  I used Morning Star Farm crumblers instead of ground beef, doubled the recipe, added a bit of cinnamon between the eggplant layers, and 'sweated' the eggplant slices (as suggested by most reviewers).  The preparation took much longer than described.  However, it was totally worth every second!!  I coupled the Moussaka with Kittencalskitchen's greek salad as well.  That was the first time I had every made my own salad dressing.  Well, I received so many compliments during dinner, after dinner, and even during the Dallas Cowboys vs Detroit Lions football game!!

This is EXACTLY the same ingredients that Mike Mills uses in his magic dust for a multitude of recipes & keeps on every table at the 17th Street Bar & Grill. It is the MOST STOLEN item from his restaurant according to Mike in his book Peace, Love, & Barbeque. Heat and spice can be adjusted by varying the mustard and black pepper to taste... I recommend keeping amounts the same (whether doubling or halving) for each to retain balance of the overall blend... but I've finally settled on the original version for my tastes. <br/><br/>This dust is excellent as a rub for ribs/pork (and other meats). The dust is versatile; it is used in 17th Street's Tangy Pit Beans, Judy Mill's From-Scratch Baked Beans (humorous book revelation about these), & 17th Street's Becky's Deep Dish BBQ Pie as well as many other uses. Think of it as an alternative to paprika whenever called for... like to dust deviled eggs. I seldom make any kind of baked bean recipe anymore without adding a little magic dust! No canned baked beans or pork-n-beans I throw together ever gets to the table without a shot of magic dust!<br/><br/>As Mike says... keeps indefinitely in a tightly covered container, but it won't last long! This is a great item to keep near the grill or stove... or on the spice carousel. People who are not DISCOVERING this dust are missing out on a major secret ingredient in many recipes of ONE of the most award-winning BBQ pit masters in the USA!
