I am on the quest for the perfect buckwheat pancakes and these are the best I've tried so far- I substituted the egg whites with one whole egg, subbed canola oil for the melted butter and used whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose.

With this I had to use just about the full amount to make the batter thick enough!

I only needed a small batch, so I halved the ingredients (omitted the milk and used only the half-and-half). As an oyster novice, I wasn't sure what it meant for the oyster to curl.

Almost followed the directions EXCEPT that I used less nutmeg (to taste) & only used 1/2 c of the potato flakes... I suspect it might be wiser to use left over cooked potatoes. When everything was added (after the beans & ham simmered for 1 1/2 hours), the soup got VERY THICK immediately & required constant stirring until the veggies cooked to keep from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Next time I make this recipe if I'm using potato flakes, I'll WAIT to add the potato flakes until the last 5-10 minutes of simmer time at the very end.

I'm a 'soak the beans overnight' kind of person so I did that in place of the boiling step.  I used a locally smoked ham hock and then added some leftover ham scraps when adding the meat from the hock.  Also, I started it kind of early and let it simmer on the back of the stove so I probably cooked for about 4 hours total and I mashed the beans down a bit with a potato masher, which adds to the creaminess.  I read some of the comments from people who said they had sticking issues with the potatoes so I added the potato flakes after I removed the ham hock and then just stirred every once in a while and it was fine, no sticking.  I do like to remove the ham hock, or bone, before adding lots of the major ingredients because it seems that the removal of that bone sucks some of the veggies and stuff along with it.  BUT, I don't like to remove it too soon because it's an integral part of the flavor in the soup.  Anyway, I made a really good pot of soup on this snowy afternoon (yes, it's April but it snowed here) and my husband got the warm fuzzies from it and went to sleep and for that, I thank you very much for this excellent recipe :)"},{"name":"nutella super smoothie","steps":"put all ingredients into blender & puree for 2 minutes or until smooth'","description":"per request, a yummy and tasty looking smoothie courtesy of nutella!","ingredients":"nutella', 'low-fat vanilla yogurt', 'skim milk', 'mixed fruit'","review":"AWESOME!!!

It's a cold and blustery midwinter night on the S A coast. I did not want a sorta BBQ dressing, so yours was just what I wanted! I followed the recipe very closely, using Bells Whisky. I had oyster mushrooms which had to be used up: chopped them, they are nicely chewy and meaty. Why not 5 stars, you might ask. Well, after tasting several times, I though that a sherry (either dry or medium) might have been more successful than whisky or the liquors you mention. The whisky left a slightly bitter taste -- I added about 1/2 - 1 teaspoon brown sugar to balance it out. I did cook the sauce down a little, more than you said. Also, the sauce had to stand a while in a warming oven, which I think improved nd mellowed the taste. Lastly, I did brush a commercial BBQ sauce on the (very thick) steaks while frying them (rare!!). Thank you for a very nice steak sauce. I will make this again, as it's fast and delicious.

We have tried too many savory recipes with cinnamon in them & no matter what meat it is we just don't enjoy that combination.  Because it was a contest ingredient I felt it necessary to use, but I cut it down to a scant 1/2 teaspoon.  I don't think the chicken handling instructions are very clear, as after prepping the chicken into thin slices step one asks me to cut the breasts in half?  At that point I had no choice but to use the strips as they were.  We really enjoyed the flavor of the fire-roasted tomatoes but I didn't have any chicken broth that wasn't in a large can so I used a 1/2 cup water & about a teaspoon of a leftover Top Ramen seasoning packet.  I have to say I was leary about cooking cucumber in the first place, but in the end I really didn't want to overcook the chicken so after I added the broccoli slaw, zucchini & cucumber I just stirred & served it.  We like our veggies with a little crunch still in them so omitting the last 5 minutes of cooking was fine.  By the time I got photos taken the veggies had steamed themselves into perfection anyway & the chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I'll most likely make this again as it was very quick & easy but I won't use the cinnamon next time.  Even just a small amount of it was too much.  Thanks for sharing your creation!

This was really good though I preferred the parts separately more than together. The corn and shrimp cakes have a very delicate flavor and the salsa, though quite delicious, has such a strong flavor from the onion and pepper it overwhelmed them. I really like the zip from the chipotle and cilantro and next time will just add them to the cakes and serve them on greens with a fruit vinaigrette. I cut this down to 2 servings, which made 3 smallish cakes and to me was a single serving. I started with uncooked, shelled and deveined shrimp, and just had to boil them a few minutes to cook them, I think they have a nicer flavor then starting with already cooked shrimp. I also used frozen corn as I was only using 2 TBLS and the fresh corn is not good yet in this area. I used my mini chopper and mixed the corn, egg, and buttermilk together; it wasn't totally smooth but worked just fine. I can't wait to make these for my DH, I know he'll love them too!

I'd read the other reviews before making this dish, and had pretty much decided how I was going to approach it. All my changes were out of necessity. We can't get vidalia onions in Australia, so I used half of a smallish red onion. Our sour cream is already extremely thick, so I didn't bother with the flour, and did not need or miss it. Had no corn flakes or mozzarella on hand, so used multigrain crackers and a mix of grated cheddar and parmesan. Never intended to make so many modifications, but it goes to show you how versatile and forgiving this recipe can be. As another reviewer said, this recipe is perfect for larger, less-than-perfect beans%u2014which is what I had. There were seven of us and everyone smacked, smacked their way through the beans.

It&#039;s a bit of work to chop everything and grind it in the food processor twice but totally worth the effort and time required. I used two onions instead of three (since I forgot to buy extra onion for this recipe and that seemed to work out just fine as far as the composition went.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My main problem was when I put the balls in the pan to fry they completely fell apart in the oil. The recipe didn&#039;t mention how much to use so I filled the pan at least an inch thick (I assume you need to immerse the balls when you are deep frying and since I didn&#039;t have a deep fryer I used a work-around). I don&#039;t think the 2 tbsp flour was enough to hold the contents together. (I used a brown rice flour...maybe another flour would hold better. Or sprinkling flour on the board when kneading could also help as well (that might be a detail left out that is assumed all would follow but I didn&#039;t since I am gluten-free and am trying to limit my flour intake.) It is also quite possible the oil temperature was not hot enough.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I ended up forming balls using a spatula in an empty skillet with all the extra olive oil absorbed and they still tasted good although they didn&#039;t have the firm exterior and shape you normally expect with falafel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would definitely try this recipe again to hopefully experiment. If I make it again I would try to remove more of the moisture from all the herbs so the balls are dryer when you mix. I noticed they were a bit saturated with moisture when I rolled them. If anyone has any suggestions or better luck in cooking these so they don&#039;t fall apart, please let me know what worked for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, I could not find dried green fava beans at the neighborhood specialty store (Armenian), regular supermarket or at Whole Foods and Sprouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used canned organic fava which I think worked out as a substitute.

The same holds true for the potato topping.  The 1/4 cup of milk certainly wasn't enough to make a 'spreadable' potato topping and, again, I had to add considerably more to achieve that.  Another thing is that the flavour of the roasted garlic just wasn't 'there' in any sense of the word, and I'm wondering if the roasted garlic (and more of it!) could not have gone to better use in the potato topping to give that more flavour as it was basically tasteless?

I put 6 ice cubes at the base of the glass(something very much I required to get the chilled feeling to this smoothie). Then, I put the banana and the mango juice in my mixie and processed until smooth to get a orange-yellow smoothie. Then, I put in the strawberries and honey in my mixie and processed to get a rose pink coloured smoothie. Lastly, I put in the yogurt in my mixie and processed till smooth to get a white smoothie.. Thus, I had a 3 colour smoothie - I put the pink smoothie first into the glass over the ice cubes, followed by the yellow-orange and lastly, the white smoothie. It looked so presentable and appealing! I'm going to call it Rose-Sunflower-Tulip Smoothie and think of my Auntie Bev'll whenever I make it again(which is for sure very very soon!)
