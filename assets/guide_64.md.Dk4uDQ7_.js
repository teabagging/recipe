Made it for myself for Thanksgiving, cuz I wanted a different kind of dessert this yr. This is a very moist cake, so it doesn't need to be frosted.  One thing that was not mentioned here, before adding cake batter to the pan...one should grease and flour the bundt pan first.  The recipe states to stir 2-1/2 cups of batter into pumpkin mixture, but I only added 2 cups.  When I added the batter to the pan, I first added a layer of the yellow cake batter all around inside the pan, then I added dollops of both batters (the yellow cake batter & the pumpkin cake batter) alternately here and there to the pan, so no need to swirl the mixture at the end as suggested. I baked my cake in a 350 degree oven for exactly 47 minutes. I think if I would of baked it at 375 degrees, it would of gotten to dark and perhaps been burnt. I enjoyed eating this cake with dollops of French Vanilla Cool Whip. I'll be having this yummy cake for tomorrows breakfast w/a cup of coffee, cuz it's sooo delish!!

Half a recipe gave me 5 ...7 ounce custard cup portions, so this recipe goes a long way..and each size portion was exactly enough. It didn't begin to fall at all until about 7 minutes after out of the oven, and didn't collapse when spoon was inserted either. So is a nice one for company.

So far, all the recipes I've made have been good (edible), but this is the one my teenage boys said YUM, this is a keeper!. And rest of my family agrees. My search is over, I'm adding this to my personal cookbook, and moving on to conquer other foods! The dough was a little more wet than others I've used, but that could be due to my substitutions (see below). Once I began working with it on a floured countertop, it became very easy to work with, so I probably had added too much liquid. They baked up light and fluffy on the inside with just a little crunch on the bottom and top. I made these variations: instead of heavy whipping cream (expensive where we live)I searched online for a substitute and used 1/3 c. softened (almost melted) butter and 3/4 c. milk for each cup of flour used. Also, because I made the biscuits about 1 1/2 to 2 inches tall, they were huge and had to bake about 14 minutes for the insides to not be doughy. Before baking, I also used my fingertip to top each biscuit with a little milk which made them brown nicely. Using 1 1/2 times the recipe, it made 9 huge biscuits. Topped with a little sausage gravy, one biscuit filled me up -- definitely hit the spot!

Great flavor.  I used half Granny Smith and half Ginger Gold apples.  The Granny Smith apples were cut in eighths and the Ginger Gold quartered so that they would be done at the same time.  That worked well, keeping some chunks in the sauce.  That apple combination was a tad too dry; adding a couple of juicier apples might be good.  Or a tablespoon of cider if you have it.  Much depends on the type of apples you use, gotta have the tang in there for me.  I used ground cinnamon instead of sticks, just because I didn't want the cinnamon flavor to be overwhelming.  Use this as a method, changing flavors to suit your own taste.  Chicago Chef, thanks for posting.

I've made this recipe several times now using straight Fuji, Mitsu and Jonagold. My favorite combo right now is Mitsu and Macintosh. I'm going to try Crimson Red and Gala. I found the mix of sweet and tart apples more complex than a sauce made solely of sweet apples. Don't skip the salt or lemon juice. I tried simply roasting the apples and the resulting sauce wasn't as good without those ingredients. The butter does lend welcome flavor and creaminess to the sauce, but I made a batch without it because of my lactose intolerance. I never made this with the cinnamon. I was going for pure unadulterated applesauce.

Texas Germans) that I use, but they are very similar.  About the only difference is we use 2 eggs and nutmeg instead of allspice.  Anyway, you will not get the same flavor if you use green grapes from the store.  The reason for using the young wild mustang grapes is the tartness.  The grapes are tart and the filling is sweet.  I don't know where you live in Texas, but maybe you can find some of the vines along the road.  That is what I do--when I remember and I hate it when I forget because then I am stuck for another year before I can make it again.  The grapes in Central Texas are ready for picking for this recipe (before the seeds really form is when you want them) at the end of April and early May.  I stop alongside the road and pick what I want and then just take them home, wash and freeze.  When I am ready to make a pie I take out about a quart and boil them with a little water.  I cook them until they are a little soft and drain off 1/2 of the water (no exact science here) and then put in the baking soda, mix the rest of the ingredients together and then add to the grapes.  Pour into a pie shell and bake.  This recipe is extraordinary.  Well worth trying to get the grapes and make.  A little trip down memory lane.

It's hearty, warming, and inviting, and has a greatly satisfying texture and consistency. Last night, I'd added some diced red &amp; green bell peppers and finely chopped baby spinach. If sodium isn't an issue for someone, a bouillon cube adds a flavor boost, as does 1/2 tsp. of crushed Italian seasoning. It's tasty with Middle Eastern spices added or great with curry powder or curry paste added for a more exotic faux Mulligatawny variation. Your favorite salsa, picante sauce, a small can of green chilies, or Southwest-style diced tomatoes can change it up easily for a different twist on it, with a handful of crushed tortilla chips or even a few Fritos also tossed into it. Wonderful way to use up any leftover roasted or rotisserie chicken too. Beans, lentils, and peas work great in it also, and when I'm feeling particularly decadent, I quarter 2 hotdog-sized Polska kielbasa sausage links length-wise, and then dice the quarters into small pieces, to give it a hint of rich sausage flavor. Diced leftover Italian sausage or meatballs work well in it, also.
