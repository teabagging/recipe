I always make it in advance. It has replaced our need to buy garlic hummus from Trader Joe's. I follow the recipe exactly and at least double or triple the amount of roasted garlic and add about 1/4 tsp cumin. The recipe also calls for 2 cups chickpeas. I just use 1 can (16oz), which when drained only yields about 1.5 cups chickpeas, which works fine. I have noticed that the mixture is runny and is very lemony immediately after a spin in the food processor. Don't worry, within a day or two, the mixture will thicken and the flavors will develop really nicely.

Cook the bacon over low to med-low heat to render as much grease as possible.  While bacon is cooking, clean and prepare potatoes for boiling.  I cut the potatoes in halves or thirds to make them approximately the same size for even cooking.  In salted water, bring potatoes to a rapid boil for 5 to 10 minutes, cover and turn off heat.  Let sit, covered to finish cooking for 20 - 30 minutes.  I find cooking the potatoes this way, I avoid over cooking and lessen the mush effect of an over cooked exterior. Once bacon is VERY browned and crisp, add 1 large onion - diced and 2 Cups coarsely chopped celery.  Saute until onions are just starting to become transparent.  Remove from heat.  Mix remaining ingredients (I use about 3/4 C sugar and about 1 1/2 C vinegar [cider vinegar offers a nice flavor as well]).  Once well beaten, add to bacon pan, mixing well, return to heat, constantly stirring till thickened.  Combine with sliced potatoes.

It. Was. Heaven. Seriously the best fish dish I have ever had. I have been singing its praises to my husband for years. But every time he goes to Texas with me something happens and we can&#039;t make it to the restaurant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So yesterday I&#039;m in the fish market and it occurs to me... wonder if anyone has posted the recipe for this dish? I was very excited to see that it was posted, and I started to throw ingredients to cart. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I get back home and the first thing I did is start making the broth. This is where I deviated from the recipe. I have made the mistake of using weak seafood broths in complicated dishes before. Complete waste of effort. So while I used all the shrimp shells as directed, I had bought head on shrimp, and I added the heads AND I had decided to use  whole dungeness crab meat (it&#039;s crab season) for the sauce, so I threw in all the crab shells and guts including the tomalley. I also increased the onion to 1/2 an onion for the broth. The resulting broth was rich, and decadent. Perfect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was my only deviation from the recipe. Otherwise we followed it exactly, measuring everything (I rarely do this). I put it in the fridge overnight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then we made the rest of the dish tonight. By the time we dirtied the 4th pan, my husband was like &quot;there is nothing that justifies this much work.&quot; and &quot;we&#039;re never making this again.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then he tasted it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I still don&#039;t know if I can talk him into making it again.  Now that we&#039;ve made it once, I can make it again alone. He did say that &quot;flying to Texas and going to the restaurant might be easier.&quot; But he really enjoyed it and admitted that it was a &quot;10&quot; as far as fish dishes go. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an exact match to the restaurant&#039;s recipe. And it IS worth the effort. Though I would make sure that you have hours for to spend in the kitchen before you decide to commit."},{"name":"canadian kebabs  eh    zwt ii","steps":"in a lrg resealable bag , combine vinegar , garlic , syrup , onions , whiskey , cloves , salt & pepper', 'set aside 4 tbsp of marinade for basting', 'trim fat from steak', 'cut into 1 cubes & add to the bag', 'seal tightly & refrigerate for 30 min or overnight', 'discard marinade used on steak', 'thread steak & orange chunks onto metal or soaked wooden skewers', 'place skewers on a greased grill over med-high heat', 'close lid & cook 4-5 min per side or till browned but still pink inside'","description":"finally, the recipe i was searching for when i stumbled over the other 2 i just posted. the website source for this recipe is joycesfinecooking.com/canadian_recipes. altho not kid-friendly w/whisky in the marinade, it is a sml amt & it appears the marinade could be halved & used to fix adult & kid portions. this recipe caught my eye because i thot it would also work well w/lamb meat. altho unusual to combine lamb w/oranges, it sounded good to me. think about it ... lamb, oranges, whole mushrooms & onion (all marinated using this recipe & cooked on the grill). how could that ever be bad? not!

Instead of water added to the mayo, I think it might be nice to add champagne vinegar to it for a little tartness.....or fresh lemon juice?   I loved the crispness of the al dente green beans against the salmon and potatoes.   You wouldn&#039;t think 1/3 cup of mayo would be enough, but it really is enough.

I still added the tomato sauce though as I used 3 cups of pasta.  I also added some chopped up pepperoni and a handful of mushrooms. I also used about a 3/4 teaspoon of the spice mixture used to make Debbie's crockpot chili (#45069)as my husband and I like some spice. When I saw how much the recipe was going to make, I dumped it all into a 13x9 inch pan and topped with the cheese -- needed about 2 cups.
