Not the same as bacon of course...  The crunchiness is the main thing that is missing.  But the flavor is a very good substitute.   I couldn't find nutritional yeast at the store, so I just omitted it and didn't notice any problem.  Will try again with the yeast though if I happen to see it somewhere.  Also, I would recommend draining the tofu.  I started to drain it a bit but the tofu started to crack and I was worried I wouldn't be able to slice it properly.  So I aborted that plan and subsequently had trouble with the browning because of the extra moisture in the pan.  Next time, I would try gently draining it overnight, maybe wrapped in paper towels with something sitting on top of it.  \\nWe are not vegetarians but do like to eat somewhat healthy and I was curious about this recipe.  BF and DD are a bit less open to experimentation but were willing to give it a chance.  I made BLT's.  BF isn't wasteful so I knew he would eat it no matter what, but I expected DD to take one obligatory bite and then heat up some leftover pizza.  They both ate their whole sandwich and BF even had seconds!  I'm not sure how it would work in other recipes (for example when you need to crumble the bacon) because of the texture difference, but it is very tasty on sandwiches and I think it would be good in an omelette as well.  Thanks for sharing!\\n\\n**edited to add** just noticed Nikoma's review stated that she used extra firm tofu and thought the texture was great.

It was difficult to make because the recipe assumes you are familiar with it and can improvise.  \\n\\nThe first time I made it, I guessed on how much water I should be using as the recipe doesn't say (it only says that you should add some in the cooking directions).  I also substituted crushed pineapple by accident instead of pineapple tidbits.  After simmering the vegetables for 10 minutes in the chicken near the end, I noticed that the vegetables were still near raw (as a new cook, I am starting to learn these basics).  So, I simmered for another hour until the vegetables were cooked. Ultimately, it turned out very, very good - basically it was like crockpot, on a stove.\\n\\nOn the second attempt (my wife's attempt - and she has had a bit less cooking experience to date and improvises less than I), she followed the recipe as well as she could.  Unfortunately, she didn't stir enough or add enough water, so it turned out carmalized/burnt. (As a side note, she also didn't cook the rice long enough, which shouldn't be a reflection of this recipe, but I thought worth mentioning.)  This second round with this recipe produced less than favorable results.\\n\\nOverall, I think this recipe has much potential if it is updated to include a better ingredient listing (how much water to start with, what exactly goes in the marinade versus non-marinade ingredients, etc.) and cooking instructions (length of time for vegetables - unless the intention of the recipe really is for a raw vegetable taste, chicken cubed, etc.)."},{"name":"chinese chicken with leeks and black beans","steps":"cut the chicken and soak in the marinade for 15 minutes', 'heat the wok and add 1 tablespoon of the oil , along with the garlic and the rinsed black beans', 'stir fry for a moment and add the drained chicken', 'stir over high heat until the chicken is cooked , and remove to a serving plate', 'add the remaining peanut oil to the hot wok , along with the leeks', 'stir until leeks are tender', 'return chicken to the pan along with the remaining ingredients', 'stir fry for a moment , and serve immediately'","description":"you can find fermented black beans (dow see) at an asian specialty market.  this recipe comes from three great cuisines by jeff smith, also known as the frugal gourmet.","ingredients":"boneless skinless chicken breast', 'light soy sauce', 'chinese rice wine', 'fresh ginger', 'peanut oil', 'garlic cloves', 'fermented black beans', 'leeks', 'sesame oil', 'sugar'","review":"creamy yummy fudge!Just what I was looking for.\\n I had a hard time getting it to set,took overnight,but worth it.Costs way less than buying it.\\nThanks DogandCatDoc"},{"name":"chinese chicken with sweet onions","steps":"cut chicken into 1 / 2-inch cubes', 'clean bell pepper', 'cut into 1-inch chunks', 'quarter onions and slice thinly', 'in wok , heat 2 tablespoons corn oil until it begins to smoke', 'add ginger , cayenne and chicken', 'stir-fry until chicken is thoroughly cooked , about 3 minutes', 'remove to serving dish', 'add remaining corn oil', 'heat', 'add onions and pepper', 'stir-fry until onion is slightly transparent', 'return chicken to pan', 'add soy and sherry', 'stir 1 minute more', 'sprinkle with sesame hot oil', 'serve with rice'","description":"a great stir-fry.","ingredients":"chicken breasts', 'green bell peppers', 'onions', 'corn oil', 'fresh ginger', 'cayenne', 'soy sauce', 'sherry wine', 'sesame oil'","review":"I loved this, but then I love all things oreo.

I used freshly ground whole wheat pastry flour, margarine and canole oil; the rest is the same. I melted the margarine and mixed it with the oil and the honey (the missing ingred. in the directions) into the egg/skim milk mixture. After mixing the dry ingred. separately, I added to wet. Then I sprayed a bread pan and poured (not spread) it into the pan. It came out more spongy and very moist, don't know how else to describe it. My 12 yo daughter almost bit my hand off trying it :) She likes it too. Just another tip. You almost have to double the recipe to get one decent sized loaf, if you're using whole wheat (although it's not dense or heavy).  UPDATE: This made it into my Top Fav's of 2009 cookbook.

The flavour was lovely. I will def be making again and keeping a stash in the freezer. Nice to have something different for breakfast. I need to make a couple of cooking tweeks but that will come with the next batch hopefully. I read all the reviews and took on board people's tips. I stuck to the original recipe except for the flax, I didn't have any so I used an extra tblesp of flour. Rice went in warm. I split the batch in three before cooking. I oven baked some for 20 mins. These tasted the best as they were cooked through but came out much dryer (understandably) and crumbled. I couldn't handle them well with a fork. The second batch I pan fried, these were lovely and moist, held together far better and is the best way to cook them in my opinion but there was a bitter taste - I'm guessing from the flour - I don't think I cooked them all the way through in the way the oven managed to. Next time I will pay fry and then pop in the oven for five-10 mins or try cooking them on a much lower temperature on the hob. I'm going to freeze the third batch - uncooked.

The dough would not form a ball, with the measurements in the recipe ,hence the 4 star rating. I tweaked it by adding 2 more tablespoons of sour cream , and 2 ice cubes and it came together beautifully. I also used my Kitchen Aide stand mixer. The dough is in the refrigerator, ready for rolling. I will update on how the crust taste after I make the pies.."},{"name":"chipped beef on toast","steps":"in skillet , cook dried beef in butter 3 minutes', 'stir in flour', 'add milk', 'cook and stir until thick and bubbly', 'cook 1 to 2 minutes longer , stirring constantly', 'stir in worcestershire sauce and pepper', 'serve over toast'","description":"loved it as a child.","ingredients":"dried beef', 'light butter', 'flour', 'skim milk', 'worcestershire sauce', 'pepper', 'bread'","review":"This was really good and really easy to make.

I ran out of cauliflower, so I used all broccoli.  I did use all full-fat ingredients (cheeses, that is) and it was delicious.  I didn't have any dried mustard, so I just added dijon mustard to taste.  The mustardy flavor went very well.  I used a Welsh white cheddar, which was just so yummy with this.  I guess maybe I had more vegetables or something, but I made this in a 9x13 and it was quite full- I can't imagine that mine would have fit in a 9x9.  Really tasty though- great comfort food.  Creamy and full of veggies, cheese and noodles- what's not to love?
