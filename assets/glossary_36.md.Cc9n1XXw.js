Also, I stir-fried the chicken cubes in a pan with (non-extra virgin) olive oil on super high heat because I didn't have access to a grill. I skipped the sauce part of this recipe and just used store bought tzatziki. I was very happy with the spice blend for this dish! Middle Eastern food is common here in Portland, OR but I had little experience cooking it; was unfamiliar with the spices. I knew what it was *supposed* to taste like and this recipe was spot on. Fellow foodies out there might want to try the salad I made to go with it, it was a major crowd pleaser with my roommates, their girlfriends and myself. I chopped up one carrot, half a red onion, four or five small crimini mushrooms, one small zucchini, half a small can of Blue Diamond plain almonds, and then threw in a very small jar of pimentos, a clove of chopped garlic and a (regular American grocery store size? Not sure of total weight) bunch of fresh chopped spinach. Toast the almonds in a dry pan first, then add the carrots along with some olive oil to coat, then the onions. Then zucchini and other stuff and finally clear out a little space in the bottom of the pan for the garlic, throw the spinach on top, and once it's wilted it's all done. If you want to get even more fancy I bet pistachios or pine nuts would be awesome in place of the almonds. To corroborate some of the other comments, the raw chicken and spice mix does stink, it's off-putting on the first attempt. That smell decreases in intensity and combines with roasty meat vegetable scent, and by the time you're done people will be knocking on your door asking what's cooking."},{"name":"cape cod cranberry velvet pie","steps":"in a large mixing bowl , beat cream cheese until fluffy', 'in small mixer bowl , beat whipping cream , sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form', 'gradually add to cream cheese , beating until smooth and creamy', 'set aside a few whole cranberries from sauce for garnish', 'fold remaining sauce into whipped mixture', 'spoon into pi e crust', 'freeze 4 hours until firm', 'garnish with reserved berries', 'remove from freezer 15 minutes before serving'","description":"","ingredients":"ready shortbread crust', 'cream cheese', 'whipping cream', 'sugar', 'vanilla extract', 'whole berry cranberry sauce'","review":"Very nice presentation in the baskets, loved the chicken salad and the dressing.

NO. Worth every step? YES!! The flavors really complimented each other, I had to use one Gala & one Granny Smith apple, but other than that followed the recipe exact. The orange peel in the dough & the colorful filling were so pretty I had to photograph them. The dough instructions were very vague but resembled a pie crust in texture so that's how I treated it; using ice water to moisten & a fork to mix it into a workable dough. The four filled dumplings were very full but the ratio of dough to filling was just exactly right & all four fit perfectly into a 4 quart crock. I cooked them on LOW heat for just under 5 hours. I thought the creative use of ingredients in this recipe was indeed Craze-E, but the final product was delicious. The cream cheese in the filling created a slightly thickened sauce for the fruit & the dough had a texture that reminded me of a thick, chewy potsticker. (I hope that visual doesn't turn anyone off, because it was the perfect compliment to the creamy filling.) DH will eat pies & cobblers but never eats the flaky-type crusts. This dough was a huge hit. I served each dumpling with a dollop of whipped cream on top. I have to asign only 4 stars as the dough instructions could use some elaboration & the cook temp is not listed. Good luck in the contest!

The flavor is amazing because you sear the shrimp in the shell. Prep time is cut dramatically because you don't need to peel the shrimp. I love to grill some good bread brushed with olive oil to dip in the sauce that this dish makes. If it doesn't seem like there is enough sauce for me I add a little water to increase the amount.

I doubled the recipe to feed DS, DH, and I, and I think I will triple it next time as DH is a big eater and DS really went to town on it as well. I used broccoli and frozen mixed vegetables for the cooked veggies, and I think next time I will use all broccoli as it was a great fit with this recipe. I also used canned salmon--the deboned/deskinned kind b/c I was lazy LOL. About 8 oz did the trick for a doubled recipe. Thanks for posting!!

Nothing I did made it thinner.  I tried adding more broth and when I ran out of broth I tried water.  Nothing worked!  And I do like the sauce thick, but this was to where I had to spread it with a spoon and it was extremely hard to dip the tortillas.  I also felt it had virtually no flavor and tried adding additional spices with still not achieving the flavor I was looking for.  I even tried cocoa which was a suggested Mexican secret with many recipes.  Like I said, it was probably just me.  But my excitement moved to discouragement.

I wish I had a camera. It even turned out well given that I completely ignored the directions and almost created a disaster. Remember that the reason for making all the jello mixtures at once is so that they will be COOL enough to layer appropriately without MELTING the layer beneath. Guess what kind of problems I had! LOL Even if, like me, you don't have enough bowls to follow the directions exactly, it is possible to time this so it works out perfectly. As soon as you have the first layer in the fridge, prepare the white stuff. Then make the third layer. Then, at least as soon as you have placed the third layer in the pan, prepare the next layer. They have to be ROOM TEMPERATURE in order to layer (although the bottom one can be slightly warmer). Also, if your house is warm, or it is humid, or if (like me <blush>) you have just had the refrigerator door hanging open to clean it, you will need to count on an hour for each layer to set. It took me a total of 6 hours to get the final layer into the fridge. This filled my 9X13 glass pan, but I would like to use a pretty mold next time. The taste was also excellent.
