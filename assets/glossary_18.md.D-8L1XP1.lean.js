I have always had a hard time eating sweet potatoes because traditionally they are made into a sweet side dish with marshmallows or brown sugar or something of the like, which I have never cared for. This however, is the perfect way to serve sweet potatoes in my and my family's opinion. The savory paprika and garlic compliment the sweetness of the potato perfectly and provides a much healthier alternative to your standard baked potato or sweet potato souffle. I have made these twice and they really are to die-for. The second time I made them I added some chili powder and kosher salt which was even better. I used quite a bit more paprika and garlic as well to suit my family's taste.  I had a sublime accidental discovery in that I made these originally to serve along side Derf's Marinated Flank Steak with Mustard Sauce #12041, and found that the mustard sauce made the MOST INCREDIBLE dipping sauce for these sweet potato sticks since I used creole mustard in the sauce. Everything complimented each other so well that I will make that sauce just for these sweet potatoes each time I make them, not that they need anything extra, just in my family's opinion it made for the perfect side dish, especially for Phase 2 of the South beach diet!

(I dont think the numbers are correct on the nutrition fact listed; the sugar amt seems too high as does the fat content but I could be wrong?) My 4 yr old daughter wanted to make chocolate chip cookies.  I only bake with organic whole wheat flour, so I wasnt sure how they would come out as I am a TERRIBLE baker.  I took a real chance and even cut the recipe to make just 20 cookies as in the event they came out I didnt want them laying around waiting for me to eat them!  Followed the recipe except didnt mix the chocolate in.  What I did was spooned the cookie dough onto sheets using a rounded teaspoon, then let my daugher put carob chips in some, organic dark and semi sweet chocolate chips in others and in mine, walnuts.  We sprinkled the tops with just a tiny bit of raw sugar.  I did flatten them out a couple times during baking as we like our cookies flat and chewey.  They came out really super.  They were chewey but not stick to your teeth; they were soft but not like a cake and the taste was really great.  Not overly sweet; but just sweet enough; and with adding chocolate chips the sweetness ended up being perfect.  I did find that since I cut the recipe to make only 20 cookies that I had to add a bit more butter; about 1TB more I think, to make the dough bind together.  But that is to be expected with changing recipe amounts and me being an inexperienced baker.  We will be making these again and they will be our new chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Made while traveling through France during Zaar World Tour 5. So glad I stopped here! Thank you Tart!!\\nUPDATE:  I am in love with this recipe!  I made it again this weekend and here is a suggestion; go ahead and make 2!!!....it takes only an additional 10 minutes or so to prep the second tart and you can easily freeze it for later!  Also, I saved a little time by using prepared bias and crinkle cut 'carrot chips'  (prewashed and packaged right there with the carrots in the produce section).

The first time was a disaster, mostly my own fault. First, there wasn't a lot of info on the type of pan to use. I had the great idea of using a spring form pan; to get it out easily, anticipating it would be sticky. This cake is very short, only a couple of inches tall. More like shortbread. It certainly didn't fill the spring form pan enough to be able to invert as the directions said (should have thought that through a head of time). My second mistake was not trusting the directions. Cooking for 45 minutes seemed way too long to me. The disaster cooked for about 40 minutes. It wasn't fully cooked. I mistook the wet toothpic for blueberry juice. So my attempt to invert a short, uncooked cake in a too tall pan was a disaster. On my second attempt (good thing blueberries had been 4/$5 that week!) I used a 8 inch diameter 2 inch tall, non-stick pan that you'd use to cook a layer of a cake. That worked beautifully. Also, I cooked it for about 55 minutes.

(don‚Äôt burn) you just want the meat good and wet with the sauce and enough to simmer but not so much it is soupy. it should be very meaty. on the flip side if you choose a real thick sauce you may need to add a little water to thin it out. you‚Äôre looking for the same consistency as a traditional marinara sauce to spread easily and be soaked up by the lasagna.","ingredients":"shredded pork with barbecue sauce', 'lasagna noodles', 'ricotta cheese', 'egg', 'salt', 'black pepper', 'pre-shredded mozzarella cheese', 'cheddar cheese'","review":"Good.

At first my DH and I were a little hesitant to taste and as the meal went on we went from This is pretty o.k. to This is really, really good Thanks for a recipe that created a great first impression for us.  I think this would also be good for any type of beef.  This is a great one dish meal, I served over rice. The sweet potatoes were a great addition and compliment.

I made as directed except that I halved the recipe, and used two 14.5 oz. cans of petite diced tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes only because I did not have the latter. The amount of vegetable stock suggested seemed like a lot, but it ended up being just the right amount. I will say that there is A LOT of chopping and dicing to this recipe, but it is worth it in the end. I started the chopping early in the day so as to not be rushed by dinner time. One tip is to stir the dish as it cooks. The recipe specifies not to stir the dish as it cooks for 30 to 35 minutes. I suspected the rice might start to stick without some stirring, so I checked on it after 15 minutes of cooking and the rice, in fact, had started to burn and stick. So I&#039;d recommend stirring this dish at least two or three times as it cooks. I cooked for a total of 35 minutes and the consistency of the rice was perfect. Oh, and I skipped the step of heating the tomato paste separately. I added the paste directly from the can to the dish and it was delicious. I also did not add the suggested cayenne pepper, as the dish was spicy enough for my husband and I without it. I will definitely be making this dish again as part of my family&#039;s Meatless Friday meals. I think chopped mushrooms would be a nice addition to this dish aside from the listed vegetables which work so nicely together.

The demi-glace sauce was very good, and DH devoured the sweet potatoes and spooned up lots of beans.  I did not overcook the rack of lamb, so that was delicious, of course.   I made half the recipe for the rack of lamb and the sweet potatoes, and used all the beans (could only find 16-oz cans).  I made the full recipe for the sauce -- it is so annoying to have too little sauce, and my demi-glace sauce came in a 11.5-oz. carton.  We began ZWT8 Australia/NZ with Recipe #464247, for which we bought a leg of lamb and ground it ourselves for a net price of USD$7.00/lb, and loved our patties.  For today's recipe, the purchase price was $12.00/pound, but net of fat and bone, the little pieces of gold were about USD$45-$50/lb.  This dish is all about presentation.  It is smart to serve with mashed sweet potatoes and a bean medley, because this is not the time to overindulge on the meat portion (unless you have money to burn).  Note that the rack of lamb includes the filet mignon part of a lamb.  This recipe keeps every calorie it can: lots of butter in the mashed potatoes, and all the bacon fat from 1/4 pound of bacon in the sauce.  My reaction was to have a very modest amount of mashed potatoes and sauce, but DH couldn't get enough.   BTW, I microwaved my sweet potatoes (4 minutes plus 2 minutes more for each additional sweet potato) because I didn't want to tie up the oven.  Ended the meal with a palate cleanser, Recipe#435991.

It only made enough for 2 standard pans. They were rather dense and not very flavorful. I&#039;d recommend increasing the spices and possibly sugar depending on the sweetness of your bananas. Baking powder, like someone else mentioned, is probably necessary to improve the density."},{"name":"barefoot contessa s italian wedding soup","steps":"preheat the oven to 350 degrees f', 'to make the meatballs~ place the ground chicken , sausage , bread crumbs , garlic , parsley , pecorino , parmesan , milk , egg , 1 teaspoon salt , and 1 / 2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl and combine gently with a fork', 'with a teaspoon or small portion scoop , drop 1 to 1 1 / 4-inch meatballs onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper', 'bake for 30 minutes , until cooked through and lightly browned', 'set aside', 'while the meatballs ar baking , prepare the soup broth: heat the olive oil over medium-low heat in a large pot', 'add the onion , carrots , and celery and saute until softened , about 5 minutes , stirring occasionally', 'add the chicken stock and wine and bring to a boil', 'add the pasta to the simmering broth and cook for 6 to 8 minutes , until the pasta is tender', 'add the fresh dill and then the meatballs to the soup and simmer for 1 minute', 'taste , and add salt and pepper if needed', 'stir in the fresh spinach and cook for 1 minute , until the spinach is just wilted', 'ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle each serving with extra grated parmesan'","description":"adapted from barefoot contessa back to basics.  i often freeze half of the meatballs to make it much less time consuming to have this delicious soup for another meal.","ingredients":"ground chicken', 'chicken sausage', 'fresh white breadcrumbs', 'garlic', 'fresh parsley leaves', 'pecorino romano cheese', 'parmesan cheese', 'milk', 'extra-large egg', 'salt & freshly ground black pepper', 'olive oil', 'yellow onion', 'carrot', 'celery', 'chicken stock', 'dry white wine', 'small shell pasta', 'fresh dill', 'baby spinach'","review":"This stuff is lethally delicious.

I definitely used more than 1/2 tsp cumin, probably about 2 tsp in all, omitting the hot pepper sauce, as I really didn't have any quality product available.  The cumin seed that I used really gave the beans a great flavor, they were very sweet and tasty unlike the canned refried beans, which are loaded up with salt.  The second day they tasted even better, not to my surprise, as many things do taste better the second day for some reason.  I made homeade guacamole from a recipe that I found on Recipezaar and quesadillas from my Chicken and Spinach Quesadilla recipe on this website.  It was a very enjoyable meal!

Since I was serving these to kids, I left out the hot pepper sauce.  I also found it necessary to add 1-2 teaspoons of salt.
