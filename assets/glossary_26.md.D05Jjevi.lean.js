Extremely easy to prepare with wonderful flavor.  This tastes even better when it is a leftover!  I made it with 5 fairly large chicken breasts and still had some sauce leftover.  I used it the next day in quesadillas and it was terrific.  The chipotle gives it just a little bit of spice without being too hot.  I might even add a little more next time.  I used regular dijon mustard and it was just perfect.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

I doubled the sauce and marinated a 2 1/2 lb. bone-in turkey breast half in 3/4ths of the sauce for 8 hours.  I then grilled the turkey breast using the indirect method on a charcoal grill - no need for basting - and cooked it until it reached a temp. of 180F on an instant read thermometer.  The sauce/marinade made the turkey breast really moist and juicy, and it was very flavorful (maybe a little too spicy for children).  I never did serve the reserved sauce, but I think I'll use it as a spread on sandwiches I'll make of the leftover turkey.  Can't wait to make this recipe when entertaining.  Thank you, Rita L.!

It turned out to be very easy to keep everything together (though I missed out on the fancy layers) and I even had some left over to spread on bagels! Instead of using mayo and ranch mix, I just used about 3/4 cup of ranch dressing. I also added a little bit of garlic powder and salt to my spread.

If I ever do make this again, I&#039;ll use pie crust.  However, the meat mixture may have been better if I had celery, which I was out of and didn&#039;t realize it until I was well into preparation.  I substituted some green beans.  So, I probably shouldn&#039;t have even rated this because I didn&#039;t really follow the recipe.  However, I think those small changes didn&#039;t make that much difference.  The basic mix of meat and veges is your typical soup combo.  While I was generous with the Parmesan, it could have taken even more.  The chili pepper flake amount was about right for my taste, but more would have been OK because I used mild sausage.  If you use hot sausage, don&#039;t increase the red pepper flakes.  I think there is something missing from this.  Maybe a bay leaf in the meat mixture while it simmers would be good?  I doubt I&#039;ll make it again, mainly because it took me 40 min. just to gather and prep all the ingredients.

However, I didn't have coke in hand, so I used 1 cup of 7-Up, and added 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce. I also added carrots to the dish. The only problem I had was with the cooking time. The recipe says 8 hours on high, which seemed like a long time on high, as another reviewer mentioned, who thought it must have been a mistake, and it should be on low. I cooked it on high for the first 2 hours, and switched it to low for 6 1/2 hours more. It was still not tender, though it was not hard either. One flaw of this recipe is that the author doesn't mention the size of the brisket, and that affects the measurement of the ingredients. Before fixing the dish, I was trying to figure out the size of the beef, and I was able to do it by multiplying the serving size (80 g) by the number of servings (8). I only had to convert then the grams into pounds, which was not too difficult: 640 g is equivalent to 1 lb 6.5 oz. Aha! My brisket was 2.1 pounds, just a little bigger than Mirj's brisket, so I used the same measurements for the rest of the ingredients. I would advise the author to add the size of the brisket to the recipe; that would be a great help. In sum, the author's cooking time must have been correct: 8 hours on high. However, I think it would be better to cook it on high the first hour or two, and then on low for, at least, 10 to 12 hours. If you add all this up. It would take a total of 12 to 14 hours, though I imagine you could also cook it for a longer period of time, preferably overnight. All in all, I loved the sauce and the flavor of the meat!

I've made these a few times now and each time I like it. I only had a 10 oz can of enchilada sauce so I substituted the rest with a jar of pace picante sauce. I added some garlic powder and cumin after mixing in the sauces. I used the soft taco size tortialls and those worked very well for me.

I planned to make per recipe with the addition of some taco seasoning, using corn tortillas (can't eat gluten), and that's what I *thought* I did. Well, not so much. When it was done, we dug in and found that it had more heat than we thought it should, and a much smokier, fuller flavor. I figured it was the brand of enchilada sauce I used and decided to omit the taco seasoning next time. Well, I checked the can and found that it was Red Chile Sauce. Oops. No worries, though, it was still delicious. I kept my tortillas from breaking by using my fingers to spread a bit of water over them before briefly steaming both sides in a hot skillet. They were very pliable. I also spooned a couple tablespoons of the sauce in the bottom of my casserole dish to make sure the tortillas wouldn't stick. Cleanup was a breeze, no need to spray the dish with oil. With just 2 of us I divided the recipe into 2 8x8 casseroles and will freeze one. As easy as this is, I think it would be even easier done as a layered casserole. The corn tortillas held together but cut easily with a fork, as they should. Even with my major error, this is a very tasty dish, going into my monthly rotation.
