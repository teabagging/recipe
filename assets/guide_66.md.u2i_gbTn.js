Next time I might leave the sour cream out totally, take the sauce out of the crock pot, thicken it on the stove with cornstarch, and then stir in the sour cream and ranch dressing for more of a gravy than a sauce.

My mom made these for special occasions when I was growing up, and I got in the mood to have them the other day.  I decided to try this recipe rather than use my mom's version because she uses all cans of refrigerated biscuit dough for the rolls, and I wanted to try a from-scratch version instead.  I followed the recipe exactly except I made sure to spray my casserole dish with some Pam before putting in the rolls to help get them out onto the serving tray easier.  The rolls were pretty fluffy and the sticky caramel sauce made them a good treat for us.  Next time, I will follow the posted suggestion of doubling the ingredients for the sticky caramel sauce to make them more gooey (there was coverage with the original recipe, but we would have definitely enjoyed more sauce).  I also plan on dividing the dough into more pieces so that I end up with smaller rolls to pull apart next time.  One suggestion I have based on the way I've had it in the past is that my mom always baked the rolls in a Bundt pan so that when you tip it out onto the serving tray it has a fancier presentation for special occasions.

Part of the problem was the pan size. I know you did say a cookie sheet. I used a 9 by 9 by 1-inch rimmed pan, which was probably about half the necessary size. Nothing overflowed, but all the raisins sunk to the bottom and the cake was too fragile to get out of the pan in nice pieces. Not the recipe poster's fault, so no stars. I buttered the pan, but the cake stuck badly, so I would recommend using paper. Also, the 1 teaspoon salt called for seemed excessive to me from the start. I used 1/2 teaspoon, and think that even 1/3 teaspoon salt would be fine. Personally, I thought the cake was too sweet, and the flavor of the raisins was overshadowed by the cinnamon. I also think that modern raisins are softer than those of previous times. If I were going to make this again, I would bring 1 cup of water to a boil, add the raisins, turn off the heat and proceed from there, but with only 1/2 cup sugar (or so) and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I also had quite a lot of white lumps of flour that didn't get properly mixed in. This may have been because of my carelessness, or the particular flour I used. I am using the word cake throughout this review because that's what I got. However, if baked in the proper size pan, I think you would get something more like fairly thin, rather soft bars. Anyway, I'm glad I tried this recipe. I would still be wondering about it if I hadn't. It is a very easy recipe, that uses common pantry items, too.

With the dried cranberries/craisins I used instead of cherries it looked very pretty and festive.  My only concern (and it may be my fault not the recipe's)  is that I used finely chopped white Callebaut chocolate instead of the white chocolate disks and we ended up with a fairly solid 1/2 inch top on this thing.  You can cut through it with the serving spoon (even when its cold) but the chocolate in no way melted.  It is still sitting on top with the craisins and raw sugar decorating it.  \\n\\nHaving said that, the flavour is marvelous and I will make it again.  I will try using the cheaper melting disks though (hate the flavour....oh, what to do) and see if they sort of melt more into the dessert.

MIL, DH etc. I couldn't try it because of allergies. The only thing I would do different is not make so much crust or break some off before baking as it was too hard and high up the sides and consequently hard to cut as well. I may not have used enough pudding mixture to fill but still I think it would have been too hard in texture. My oven is not a great one, nor have I made puff pastry before but I did see another reviewer with the same problem of the crust being hard. Maybe I over mixed? I used sweet butter (unsalted), a regular Philadelphia cream cheese from Canada, 2 regular size Selection brand vanilla pudding packages and added a little additional alcohol free vanilla, I used the Cool whip in a thin layer (not sure as much as the recipe called for), plus I used magic shell like other reviewers for the chocolate drizzle but it didn't get hard. Maybe I didn't shake it enough.. I did put it into a ziplock bag with a tiny corner cut off to make thin drizzle since the bottle had a large opening.

Cheese definitly will not brown like the photo of the small squares you see in the one photo in the 2 or 3 minutes suggested. You would need to use your broiler or a torch or bake longer at higher temp to brown the cheese. I suppose it could depend on the cheese you use. They look like they would be great finger food in that photo but you will most likely need to eat them with a fork on a small plate. They will cut into squares or triangles but are more the consistancy of quiche. I read a review that stated they were a little bland and I agree. I would add maybe 1/4 to 1/3 more cheese but place it over the broccoli mix in addition to the cheese on top. I love walnuts but this might be better without them or maybe some chopped cooked bacon instead. The walnuts did not make it better. I originally chose to make this recipe because I thought it would be a good way to make use of the walnuts I already had on hand. I'm not big on salt and feel most recipes don't need more salt but this one does. Bacon instead of walnuts would add more salt flavor without adding straight salt. I used salted butter but it could still use more salt. I read another review that mentioned the top having pools of oil. Mine had pools of oil from the melted cheese too when it came out of the oven. While it was still hot I carefully soaked up as much of the pools of oil as I could with a paper towel. I also might use more biscuit mix to give them a little more body and maybe a slightly thicker biscuit layer. You can try this recipe exactly like it is but most likely you will end up thinking you should have used some or all of my suggested tweaks.

The sauce comes out orange, similar to duck sauce, so please serve with a strong green contrast. Blanched chopped red peppers could also aid the presentation, although DH didn't care one whit how it looked. DH wants it again tomorrow night! After modest portions for dinner, I had enough for two more dinners for two, plus a freezer bag of 3/4 cup sauce to play with.

At first I followed the recipe except for adding half herbs de Provence to half the oregeno, decreasing the cayenne because DH can't eat overly hot spicy, foods and decreasing the recipe size. It took over and hour and a half of cooking until the chops were tender enough to eat. The flavor of the sauce was rather bland, except for the back up heat from the cayenne and the pepper.

The sauce had a very unappetizing curdled look to it until I used my immersion blender which made it nice and smooth. After trying the sauce and finding it to be rather bland I added a little dijon mustard and a splash of chardonay, which gave it a some extra flavor.

I have made this recipe about 15 times, and only twice has it been ruined. Those two times were the result of a poor meatloaf pan. It is very important to have a good nonstick pan, and also one that has a good lip. I'm no cooking expert, but I definitely noticed that when we used a light, shiny, thin meatloaf pan with no nonstick surface, it deflected heat and made cooking time much longer resulting in a tough, hamburgery meatloaf that is disappointing and can put off a big meatloaf fan for quite a while. It's worth the investment to get a good pan, and we noticed that it was dark grey and definitely nonstick. A bad pan can make or break your meatloaf. Also, how well you combine your meatloaf can really affect how it holds its form. If you don't mix up the ingredients enough, you will be able to tell because the meatloaf will have a giant crack in the middle, and certain parts will be overcooked, and some undercooked. It's important to flatten it out evenly instead of letting the middle be thicker than the rest, which is asthetically pleasing, but doesn't cook as well. I always double wrap to the lip with foil very tightly, and after about 45 minutes, I drain the grease and cook it for the last 15 minutes uncovered to get it just right on top, and then drain again. I've seen some people talk about putting white cheddar cheez-its in, and that helped a little. I also substituted quick oats for crackers once, and it was about the same but less salty (so don't be afraid to do this if you are in a pinch)."},{"name":"marinated mushrooms  artichoke hearts  and cauliflower salad","steps":"saute mushrooms in a little butter about 5 minutes', 'break cauliflower into small flowerettes and steam for about 5 minutes', 'cut artichoke hearts into quarters', 'combine all ingredients in big bowl , including liquid from artichoke hearts', 'marinate at least overnight', 'keeps indefinitely in refrigerator', 'slightly cooked pieces of carrots can be added for more color', if the liquid doesn't cover the veges , i add water , oil and vinegar in proportionate amts until vegs are covered]","description":"i got this recipe from a former roommate of mine, this is her mother's recipe.","ingredients":"mushroom', 'marinated artichoke hearts', 'cauliflower', 'water', 'salad oil', 'garlic clove', 'cider vinegar', 'salt', 'peppercorn', 'dried thyme', 'oregano'","review":"I had a yam and some feta to use up; so this seemed to fit the bill.
