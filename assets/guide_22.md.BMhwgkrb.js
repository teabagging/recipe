I did everything as the directions stated, so I decided to look at some other recipes to try to figure out what the problem might have been. Some other recipes say 12 egg whites or enough to equal 1 1/2 cups. I am thinking that since I used farm eggs and some of them are pretty big that I ended up with too many egg whites...so next time I am going to measure my egg whites to see if this will correct the problem.

Thanks for sharing! My observations and suggestions: No fat! No greasing the pan, not even a drop of yoke in the whites, no wooden spoons (contain natural oil), no plastic or latex bowls or utensils (oil adheres), wash hands before and during prep (especially if a yoke breaks). The reasons many AFC'so fail are due to one or more of the following: an introduction of oil, not beating the whites long enough (beyond a medium peak), not sifting ingredients, use of a non-stick pan (the batter must stick so that it can climb as it bakes), and, not handling the beaten whites gingerly. For this recipe I heeded caution and I did reduce the sugar by just 2 T. The sweetness turned out perfectly for me though following the recipe precisely would have been fine too. My oven is precise, so I reduced baking temp to 350 and baked for 40 mins. which turned out perfectly. I sifted my ingredients twice. I also used extra fine granulated sugar (carried by most grocery stores near the brown and powdered sugar section). Finally, folded in the final ingredients, using a large stainless steel spoon, then I spooned the batter into my fluted pan rather than poured.

The sour cream DOES make a difference. It made a richer, moister bread. If you are in a pinch and only have the yogurt its still a wonderful bread but the sour cream makes it that much better.
