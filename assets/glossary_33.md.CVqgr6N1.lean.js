We have fresh mangos and pineapples at the moment, so the Mango Salsa was delicious. For the Crispy Coconut Chicken I would make two changes.  1 - I would halve the coconut and panko mixture (I had to throw half of it out). 2 - I would slice the chicken in half or use a tenderiser to pat out the thicker bits of the chicken.  I found they took a little longer to cook and the coconut coating was almost burnt.  I used normal eggs for Hubby and Little Miss (DD) but used egg substitute for myself.  For the last ingredient on your list I wasn't sure what type to salsa I had to use so I used a tomato base and that worked well for us.  The meal made a complete dinner with wonderful flavours.

I had to make a few adjustments, based on availability: I used canned/drained pineapple, frozen/thawed mango, green bell pepper, sweetened coconut (but I then omitted the additional sugar to compensate), and canola oil instead of peanut. Even with these changes, we had a wonderful meal. I really liked how it all came together in terms of flavor. On their own, neither the salsa or the chicken were particularly great (to my tastes -- my roomie loved it all, even separately), but when the two combined on the tongue... WOW. I think that the next time I make this, I will follow the advice of Chef floWer and adjust the amount of the breading and make sure that I have the oil at a lower temperature, since I also had a lot of breading mixture left over and almost burnt the chicken (my error...

I've been cooking for less than a year and I have had some pretty bad screw-ups before. However, this dish was not very good at all compared to the other recipes I've tried from recipezaar. I'll explain what I did, and you can make your own opinion whether it's me or the recipe.\\n\\nI followed the recipe as closely as I could. I used spaghetti instead of vermicelli, and I forgot to add the sesame oil. Those were the only two changes. It smelled really good while cooking, but the end result was very oily and just tasted like beef fat and hoisin. None of the other ingredients were noticeable. I made myself eat a bowl of it, but when I went to heat up the leftovers later, I just couldn't bear to eat the rest.\\n\\nI had wondered whether I should drain the oil and beef fat from the pan before adding the sauce ingredients, but I decided not to because I thought it might take away the flavor of the spices that had been cooked in it. I used 80% lean ground beef, because 90% and 95% were much more expensive. Maybe the recipe was created with the less fatty kind, and that's why mine was so oily. Although 3 tablespoons of oil does seem a little excessive for cooking that amount of onions and spices, compared to other recipes I've seen.\\n\\nAs for the flavor otherwise, I think the problem isn't really too much hoisin, but actually not enough of everything else. It was just bland. I don't think adding the sesame oil would have helped; in my experience, sesame oil has a strong smell but not much of a flavor, and in any case, it would have made the food that much oilier. \\n\\n It might have worked better with some modifications, such as using less oil, using leaner beef, and adding more garlic, ginger, pepper flakes, and soy sauce. Adding vegetables, like many of the previous reviewers did, might also improve it. However, I probably will not try this recipe again. I would rather look for a different recipe for ground beef and noodles than try to alter this one."},{"name":"butternut squash chocolate chip muffins","steps":"preheat oven to 400f', 'spray muffin tins with low-fat cooking spray or line with cupcake papers', 'in medium bowl , mix together wet ingredients', 'let sit for 5 minutes', 'in large bowl , whisk together all dry ingredients', 'add wet ingredients to dry and mix until combined', 'put into muffin tins', 'bake 20 to 25 minutes'","description":"delicious muffins for any occasion. to increase fiber, use kellog's all-bran buds.","ingredients":"egg', '1% low-fat milk', 'vinegar', 'butternut squash', 'splenda brown sugar blend', 'bran buds', 'whole wheat flour', 'wheat bran', 'ground flax seeds', 'wheat germ', 'cinnamon', 'baking powder', 'baking soda', 'chocolate chips'","review":"Unlike Mars.Ombriel, I've been cooking quite some time and actually know how to do so.

I made my own lasagne noodles with sundried tomatoes, so it wasn't necessary to preboil, and put into 2 casseroles so I could freeze one. Not sure what teleme cheese is- don't think we have it here, so used extra mozarella and marble cheese. Also added mushrooms, peppers etc. to sauce as always. Thanks MarieAlice for some great comfort food:-)."},{"name":"cabbage casserole with an oriental flair","steps":"brown onion in margarine until soft', 'add ground beef , salt , pepper and brown', 'drain any fat off mixture', 'put chopped cabbage on top of meat mixture', 'cover and steam 10 minutes', 'mix together , stirring , and add water chestnuts , celery soup , cheddar cheese', 'add sour cream last , careful not to heat mixture too high', 'put in greased casserole dish', 'bake at 325 degrees for 30 minutes', just before it's done , sprinkle chow mein noodles on top, 'let stand about 5-10 minutes before serving', serve soy sauce along side to be added to each serving according to each person's taste]","description":"one of the all-time best comfort food recipes i've every found. well worth the time to put it all together. sure to become a family favorite.","ingredients":"onion', 'margarine', 'salt', 'pepper', 'ground beef', 'cabbage', 'sharp cheddar cheese', 'sour cream', 'cream of celery soup', 'sliced water chestnuts', 'chow mein noodles', 'soy sauce'","review":"the graniness didnt seem to go away, even days afterwards.  it wasn't unpleasant, but i would have preferred a creamier texture, i enjoyed the taste tho!"},{"name":"cabbage casserole with leeks and pine nuts","steps":"blanch cabbage leaves in a large pot of boiling salted water 7 minutes , or until softened', 'drain , pat dry , and set aside', 'preheat oven to 350f', 'coat 8 square baking dish with cooking spray', 'heat 1 1 / 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet over medium high heat', 'add leeks and broth', 'season with salt , if you like', 'place lemon slices on top and bring to a simmer', 'cover , reduce heat to medium low and cook 25 minutes', 'drain in colander , remove lemon , pat leeks dry and set aside', 'heat remaining 1 1 / 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet over medium heat', 'add garlic , and cook 1 minute', 'add tomatoes and cook 10 minutes , or until most of liquid has evaporated', 'stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper , if desired', 'place 3-4 cabbage leaves on bottom of prepared baking dish', 'spread 1 / 4 cup of tomato sauce over leaves , top with 1 / 3 of leeks , dot with 1 / 3 ricotta , then sprinkle with toasted pine nuts', 'repeat layering 2 more times , seasoning with salt and pepper between layers , if desired , and top with fourth layer of cabbage and sauce', 'bake 25-30 minutes , or until it begins to brown on top', 'enjoy !'","description":"remove the excess moisture from the veggies and cheese before assembling to help hold this dish together. from vegetarian times magazine,  march 2010.","ingredients":"cabbage leaves', 'cooking spray', 'olive oil', 'leeks', 'vegetable broth', 'lemons', 'garlic cloves', 'chopped tomatoes', 'fresh parsley', 'low fat cottage cheese', 'pine nuts'","review":"Only had 1.25 cup of butter so that is what I used.
