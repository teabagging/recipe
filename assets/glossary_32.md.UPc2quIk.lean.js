I added some olive oil to the butter to fry the fillets. It helps prevent the butter from burning and turning black. Also, I turned off the burner when I flipped the fish. Again, this prevents burning. When you cook at high heat with butter, you need to be careful as it burns really quickly. BTW, for those who are not so experienced, high heat does not necessarily mean &quot;max&quot;. It depends of the stove and the kind of pan you use i.e. a cast iron pan can sustain much higher heat than a t-fal. When you notice it starts smoking, remove the pan from the heat and continue cooking your fish. Don't be afraid to add butter/oil. or to turn your fish earlier than 2 minutes. The best advice I can give to anyone starting to cook is do not rely 100% on a recipe. Use your nose and your eyes. Tasting most foods as they cook is also a must so you can adjust seasonings. Also a good dose of common sense is helpful. Experiment and have fun in the kitchen!

It could be due to the fact that I'm a relatively novice canner. Not sure what went wrong.

Also, I only got 3 jars per batch, not 4, but I  didn't overfill them, I followed the directions for filling the jars to the letter. My first batch came oozing out of the jars as I took them out of the canner. No headspace left whatsoever. Re-read the books, decided to do a second batch and cook the apples a little longer (to get more air out of the fruit before sealing). Filled new jars, as directed, still just 3 jars. The second batch didn't ooze nearly as much as the first, and all 6 jars have now 'sealed', but it's not a true seal that would be shelf-stable, so I'm just going to freeze them instead. <br/><br/>Anyway, aside from a bad canning experience, I really LOVE this pie filling!

I've never made bagels before, but I've done this twice now and my bagels are just delicious! They're still soft and chewy the next day (I microwave mine for 30 seconds before I slather on the cream cheese!). The first time I made these, I followed the instructions exactly. The second time, I did a little bit of altering (some based on other reviewers). I do the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle (laying from the bottom up: warm water, 1 T salt, 2 cups of bread flour, 3 T sugar, the rest of the flour, and then yeast on top). I used brown sugar and this yielded in a chewier and slightly richer plain bagel. Also, I boiled my bagels for 40 seconds per a side, brushed with egg whites, and baked them for 28 minutes on one side, and then flipped for 8 minutes on the other (so that my bottoms would be more brown the the tops). I haven yet to make any flavored bagels, but my husband is begging for a sun-dried tomato and I want to try a blueberry one. The dough is sooooo easy to work with!!

If you've never made bread before you may struggle a bit but a couple things to note if you haven't made bread before 1) Make sure you add the additional flour slowly, you don't want the dough to be sticky but you don't want to add everything at once and risk drying out your dough. I found it really helpful to sprinkle the top of my dough with flour and keep mixing it in the bowl. Resist the urge to take it to the floured surface before you've reached the non-sticky point. 2)You dough balls are not going to be perfect little balls and ITS OKAY :) The &quot;skin&quot; of the dough is soft but a teeny bit dry and can leave creases. This is 100% okay, it doesn't affect the taste of your bagel in any way and it just gives them more of that home made look. 3)Sugar and salt don't have to be exact so Google or look through these comments for helpful conversions. 4)They're delicious baked goods and shouldn't be taken too seriously.

The only flavor that any of these ingredients imparts is the flavor from buttermilk and for some reason - maybe it's the higher temperatures involved with a waffle iron compared to a skillet - buttermilk waffles have much less buttermilk flavor than buttermilk pancakes;  I believe that this is in part because modern buttermilk has much less flavor than the buttermilk of 20  years ago.  Maybe if you have some sort of organic, old-fashioned, Amish-style buttermilk, it might be a bit different, but buttermilk from Dean's Dairy, a large, Midwestern dairy, does not give this recipe any significant buttermilk flavor.  <br/><br/>First, I think that the recipe that one can download here in May of 2012 has been changed and improved upon from when the recipe first appeare here - the current recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I think some of the older recipes that complain about it being too salty were dealing with a recipe that had more salt than the currently displayed recipe.<br/><br/>Second, I recommend adding 1 1/2 teaspons of sugar to this recipe as well as a teaspoon of vanilla.

sheets of waxed paper and beat it with a rolling pin until it becomes soft and malleable', 'make sure the butter stays cold though', when you're making laminated doughs such as croissant dough , puff pastry dough , or danish pastry dough it's important that the dough stays cold so the butter and the dough form distinct layers, 'shape the block of butter into a 6- by 8-inch rectangle', 'place the block of butter somewhere cool or back in the refrigerator while you make the dough', don't let the butter re-harden though, 'if the butter re-hardens it will break through the dough when you go to roll it out', 'you want the butter cold but you also want it to be spreadable', 'for the dough combine the milk , yeast and sugar', 'let sit 5 minutes or until yeast is dissolved and the surface is all foamy', 'stir in the salt', 'stir in the 2 7 / 8 cups of flour , all at once , until thoroughly combined', 'you should have a very soft wet dough', cover the bowl of dough and place it in the refrigerator until it's chilled, 'if the dough is warm it might cause the butter to melt', 'using a shaker or a sifter , generously flour your work surface', by generously i don't mean a simple dusting, 'you want a good substantial layer of flour', 'if you can see the counter top or table top underneath the flour then you need to sprinkle on more', this dough is very wet and if you don't use enough flour on your work surface the dough is going to stick, don't add anymore flour to the dough itself because the flour you use to roll out the dough is only going to be on the surface of the dough , and it's going to be brushed away, 'roll the dough into a 10- by 14-inch rectangle', 'brush away the excess flour on the surface of the dough with a pastry brush', 'place the block of butter on one side of the dough and fold the other side over and seal the edges', 'turn the dough so that the fold is on the left and the part that opens is on the right', 'roll the dough into a 9- by 17-inch rectangle', be sure to check that it's not sticking to the table, when you you roll out the dough you want to use smooth even strokes and make sure you don't roll over the edge of the dough, if you do you'll crush the layers you're trying to make, 'use a pastry brush to brush away all excess flour off the surface of the dough', this step is important because if you don't it will keep the dough from forming the layers properly, 'fold 1 / 3 of the dough on to itself', 'brush away the flour', 'fold the other third of the dough on top of that so that the dough resembles a folded business letter', 'be sure to keep the edges and corners lined up', 'this is what\\\\'s called a turn', 'a turn gets its name because each time you roll out the dough you have to turn it a quarter turn so the position of the dough is always the same each time you roll it out', 'roll out the dough and fold the dough in thirds as you did before', 'at this point you should wrap the dough up and refrigerate it for 45 minutes to an hour', 'repeat the rolling and folding in thirds like a business letter two more times', 'refrigerate the dough for an hour between each turn', 'before rolling out the dough each time make sure you always position the dough so that the top flap has the fold on the left and the part that opens on the right', after the 4th turn the dough needs to be refrigerated for at least 3 hours or overnight if it's more convenient, 'roll the dough into a 10- by 20-inch rectangle', 'be sure the corners are square', 'cut the dough into eight squares by cutting it half lengthwise and then cutting each half into 4 squares', 'a pizza cutter is a great tool for this job', 'cut each square into two triangles', 'take one of the triangles and stretch it until the two short sides are as long as the long side', 'roll up the triangle and curve the ends in slightly to form a crescent shape', 'repeat with the rest of the triangles of dough', 'place the croissants at least 2 inches apart on baking sheets that have been lightly sprayed with cooking spray or covered with parchment paper', cover the croissants with towels and place somewhere where it's not too warm, you don't want the butter in them to become soft remember, let croissants rise until they're nearly doubled in size, 'this may take a few hours', 'be patient', i've let them rise for as long as 5 to 6 hours, 'after about 2 hours the surface of the croissants may start to dry out', 'if this happens cover them with a damp paper towel and then put another towel on top of that', 'combine the egg and the teaspoon of water', 'brush a light coating of egg wash on each croissant', if the croissants are exceptionally puffy you'll need to be extra gentle when you brush on the eggwash, 'another option is to put the eggwash in a spray bottle and spray the eggwash on the croissants', bake the croissants in a preheated 425 f oven for 12 to 15 minutes until they're golden brown]","description":"this recipe makes the best croissants.  be sure to use real butter.  if you don't, the recipe will not turn out.  if it were simply a matter of taste i would say use whatever you want, but in this case you have to use real butter because of its baking properties.  i prefer to use salted butter but you may use unsalted if you wish.  the preparation time is just a guess because you never know how long it's going to take for them to rise.  i usually let mine rise for a bare minimum of 4 hours.  so you may want to keep that in mind if you plan on serving them at a certain time.\\n\\nnote: if you wish to measure the flour by weight rather than by volume, 2 7/8 cups of flour is approximately equal to 12.68 ounces or 359 grams.","ingredients":"butter', 'all-purpose flour', 'active dry yeast', 'milk', 'sugar',

I got the recipe from the Food Network website years ago. The recipe did not list the hot sauce or garlic powder in their list of ingredients. Hmmmm? Even though I never added those two ingredients, the recipe was fantastic! Also, the recipe instructions didn't mention anything about crushing or not crushing the French Fried Onions. I always break the larger pieces of onion and leave the smaller pieces alone. My set of instructions stated, Divide the French Fried Onions into 3 portions, stirring only one of the three portions into the bean mixture. Sprinkle the remaining onions on top of the bean casserole befor placing into the oven. I use Bush's brand Original Baked Beans. I think KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce is awesome when combined with Bush's beans. Be sure and drain the crushed pineapple really well (I figure out how much pineapple I need, then with clean hands, I  take a handful of pineapple and squish as hard as I can until all of the juice has been extracted). When I use half a recipe, I use an 8-inch by 8-inch square baking dish, and I've found I don't need to grease the dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe Koechin (Chef)! ********************************************* GREAT BACON TIP : After you lay the bacon strips in the skillet, take kitchen shears, and going from one of the end of the strip of bacon to the other, in a zig-zag pattern, make about 8 small snips every so often. If any of the strips show signs of bacon fat bubbling up, quickly take your shears and snip the center of the bubble.

i live in a state that can easily be a 100 degrees for days on end during the summer and you know what butter does on hot days.  it melts!  a greasy puddle of melted icing on a cake plate is not something i want to look at or eat.  \\n\\nyour top notch decorators have a few options we don‚Äôt.  they have huge refrigerators to store their cakes in, and refrigerated vehicles that they can use to deliver decorated cakes. i even know a few that refuse to deliver at all. if you want their cake, you come and get it and it‚Äôs your responsibility if it melts.  these decorators don‚Äôt even turn on their ovens for a wedding cake for less than $2000.  \\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nthe following recipes for buttercream icing hold up pretty well in the heat and humidity, but if you know that your cake will be out in very high temperatures, then don‚Äôt use any butter and use only a high quality shortening.  \\n\\n\\nshortening:  \\n\\nsolid shortenings definitely have their place in baking. so i‚Äôm going to talk taste tests. crisco is the hands down winner. it has a clean taste with the melting point of 106 degrees. butter melts somewhere between 88 and 98 degrees f. depending on the amount of fat in the brand.  you can see that if you need to serve a pure buttercream decorated cake, on a hot august afternoon, you could have melted roses (and i do mean greasy puddles) on the tablecloth. this is when a good quality shortening will be a great blessing. i have been told by decorator friends that some of the warehouse brand shortenings leave a grainy consistency to the icing no matter what you do.  \\n\\n\\npowdered (confectioner's) sugar:  \\n\\nregarding powdered sugar. please use a cane sugar. i prefer c&h powdered (confectioners) sugar.  many of the cheaper brands use sugar beets for their base.  i don‚Äôt know the chemistry behind it but you definitely get different textures to your icing that can vary from batch to batch.  i spent a few months being very frustrated with the quality of my icing until a kind lady did a bit of trouble shooting for me. she recommended the cane sugar and i‚Äôve been blessing her ever since.\\n\\n\\ntop-quality brands:  \\n\\nplease be safe, buy a quality brands and then stick with it for the best results. a friend of mine, who is a wonderful cook and baker, travels a lot and she often prepares treats for her hosts. she‚Äôs learned to ask the host to have her favorite shortening and flour on hand. she has even made up a little makeup type case that carries her favorite extracts and precious spices. that way she knows what she is working with, how it handles, and what tastes she can expect for the finished product. some surprises are not pleasant. \\n\\n\\nstoring buttercream icing: \\n\\nif you are not going to be using the icing right away, place it in a clean, sealable bowl. store it in the refrigerator but please don‚Äôt place it next to the marinating salmon, garlic or broccoli.  you do not want those flavors in your icing!  i like to use my icing within a few days but it will hold in the cold refrigerator for a couple of weeks if necessary.  \\n\\ni often make a double batch of icing the night before i have a baking project.  that way i know that i have plenty of icing, it‚Äôs fresh and i don‚Äôt have to make it while i‚Äôm in the middle of baking the cakes.  the extra can always be used for a batch of cupcakes.\\n\\nwhen you remove the icing from the refrigerator, you might notice that the icing has taken on a sponge like texture. do yourself a favor and place the icing in a bowl and mix by hand using a back and forth, smashing motion with a spoon or icing spatula. what you want to do is to smash the bubbles out of the icing. this extra step will help to give you the smoothest icing for a pretty top and sides of the cake. i have found that you will get an even better texture of icing if it is at room temperature before you try to do your icing.\\n\\n\\nbad buttercream icing days:  \\n\\none thing that seems very silly but is true. there are bad buttercream days! i‚Äôve asked quite a few decorators about this and every one says ‚Äúyes, there are lousy days? i‚Äôm not sure what causes the problem. \\n\\nit could be that every human has bad days so they blame the buttercream. \\n\\nit may be the humidity or that there is a low pressure system hanging over your town. \\n\\ni just know why but it is a perceived fact. the way i have handled the problem is that i changed the decoration on the cake.  i couldn‚Äôt get the smooth top or sides as i originally planned. writing a greeting on a messy top would look awful so i changed the design idea and put flowers everywhere. i could have also done a basket weave technique around the sides. just go with the flow, and don‚Äôt get frustrated. aunt martha won‚Äôt chuck the cake at you if you don‚Äôt write her name on the top this time. remember that you are creating something that is to be eaten so have fun with it.  \\n\\n\\ndifferent mixers:\\n\\nif you have a heavy duty counter mixer, you can prepare a whole batch at one time.  if you are using a hand mixer, divide the recipe in half.  if you notice the mixer getting hot, please stop and let the machine cool off.\\n\\ni also prefer to mix the buttercream on a low setting. it seems that the higher setting do the job faster but you also will get a spongy texture to the icing. i don‚Äôt want that quality in my final ice coating or flowers on the cake. \\n\\n\\nusing weight scales:\\n\\n1 cup of crisco weighs 6 ounces.  \\n\\ni put a piece of wax paper on my scale and start plopping spoons of shortening on until i get the desired weight. it really saves on the cleanup.","ingredients":"powdered sugar', 'crisco shortening', 'powdered milk', 'vanilla', 'salt', 'butter flavoring', 'almond extract', 'creme fraiche', 'cornstarch'","review":"Easy, quick, and good.

The achiote adds a wonderful dimension of colour and flavour to the dish (I did not have any the first time I made it). I also used a deeper pan the second time, and it kept the dish a bit saucier. My husband said the only thing missing was vetsin (or MSG, common in Filipino cooking) to boost the flavour, but I refuse to put it in any of my food because of how bad it is for you!!! i might just add a touch of salt next time to please him.
