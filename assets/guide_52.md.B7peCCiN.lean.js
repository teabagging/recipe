I've never made this cake until today. Was looking for a dessert to use with Mexican Dinner. The information for recipes and baking times for flancake is all over the internet and most have inaccurate information about the baking time. As I read over the different recipes, it didn't make sense that some said bake 1 hour, others said up to 2 hours. If you've made flan before, common sense would tell you that flan is NOT going to &quot;set&quot; or be cool enough in 15 minutes to invert this cake. The cake isn't that expensive to make, but I could foresee flan running down the sides of the cake if not handled correctly. So, I thought it over, baked it 2 hours, tested cake with toothpick, cooled on the counter two hours, then placed the whole tube pan with cake in the refrigerator overnight. The next morning I placed the tube pan in hot water for under 5 minutes, turned it out on a large cake plate and everything held together. I left the tube pan on top until my guests arrived just to be sure the flan didn't decide to take a little hike down the side!

I experimented quite liberally with the formula, and feel free to discard my faulty methodology. For starters I soaked 1 cup raisins + 1/2 cup cranberries in mango juice + maple syrup, didn&#039;t like it, then I drained off the juice and soaked them in vanilla soy milk instead. My brown sugar was a write-off, so I used 1 cup white sugar + 1.5 tbsp molasses + 1/4 cup honey plus the butter. Added the recommended amounts of dry ingredients, yet when I mixed in the somewhat drained raisin/cranberry mixture it became too runny. Added another 1/2 cup of flour, and the cookies all melted together yet they tasted AMAZING! Added more flour and oats to subsequent batches, and they were firmer and the taste was still absolutely incredible. I can&#039;t believe I baked something so delicious.

I started with a frozen chicken breast and used diet Ginger Ale hoping to get the ginger flavor. The ginger ale added no discernible flavor and I added a bit of chicken base to the cooking liquid to give it a flavor boost. Also I need to mention that since I started with the frozen breast I gave it the full 8 hours on low. The meat was extremely dry and over cooked. Check the chicken at 4 hours and decide how much longer you want to give it.

(It really does sound lovely, but honestly! Too time-consuming! I digress....) I simply bought two 24oz containers of Ragu onion & garlic spaghetti sauce, and use about 1 1/2 jars of it.<br/><br/>Also, I used turkey instead of ground beef. When browning it, I seasoned it in the pan with Lawry's seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder, sage, Italian seasoning, & black pepper. Then I add the sauce to it, and voila! It smells so delightful, I must say. Additionally, I use a little more cheese than required, since the family and I are cheese lovers.

My husband who usually is a meat eater loved it which speaks a lot! I used a table spoon of olive oil instead of 1/2 cup of butter and it turned out well. The quiche is not too eggy and full of spinach. It might be on the cheesy side with the cheese topping though. I used the Quick and Easy dough recipe which was perfect for this quiche."},{"name":"lavender mint tea  single serving","steps":"if you have a tea ball , place the herbs in it', 'if not , you can brew this in the tea and strain it in a fine strainer after it has brewed', 'pour the boiling water over the herbs', 'let steep for 5 minutes', 'strain , if needed , and serve hot', 'sweeten , if desired', 'this can also be made as iced tea- double the herbs and let steep in 1 qt of water overnight in the fridge', 'you can add more water , to taste , if it is too strong', 'again , sweeten , if desired'","description":"due to popular demand, the proportions of mint and lavender have been altered to make this lovely tea even lovelier. :)","ingredients":"lavender flowers', 'dried mint', 'boiling water', 'honey'","review":"Delicious: I love spinach and feta and all the other ingredients in this so this recipe was very much my sort of recipe! The only changes I made were to add a handful of baby spinach leaves to the frozen/thawed spinach (for me, there can never be too much spinach in a recipe!), and I used 3 teapoons of garlic ( as for me there can never be too much garlic either!) and the rice crust from my Recipe #147047. Rather than jarred mushrooms, I used fresh sliced mushrooms which I added to the pan in step 2, as I wanted to be sure that they'd released their moisture. I used fresh as I trust them more than some of the canned and bottled mushrooms around. With mushrooms in the recipe, I also just had to add some thyme. My feta had no herbs in it so I added fresh basil. I added the mushrooms, onion and garlic in step 3. Totally yummy quiche, both warm and at room temperature. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Kizzikate.

I admit that I played with it a bit, trusting my usually-reliable palate, but not actually tasting it -- another &quot;no- no&quot; for me. As others have apparently done, I chose to use fresh spinach and mushrooms, chopping both, and added about half a sweet red pepper, also chopped. If I were making this for myself, I would likely have added Kalamata olive pieces, but not everyone loves olives as I do. CAVEAT: Make sure that you &quot;lightly&quot; saute the next year, as the recipe says. Should be over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes, or until the ingredients are softened; and be sure to take the skillet off the heat before adding the rest of the mixture, blending it thoroughly before putting it in the pie shell. Also, since all ovens heat differently, I would reduce the time by 5 minutes and then begin testing it. Even though I made somewhere between a single and double recipe, the total of 55 minutes was just about right. If I'd put it in for another 5, it would have been a little dry, and if I had taken it out even two or three minutes earlier, it probably wouldn't have been entirely cooked. Finally, I was a bit concerned that the cheddar topping might become too well done if in for the entire 40 minutes, so I chose to add it with about 15-20 minutes to go instead. If you prefer the cheddar topping crusted a bit, put it on earlier. BOTTOM LINE: The quiche was a huge hit with everyone. A couple people I didn't even know came up to me personally to tell me how much they enjoyed it."},{"name":"lavender salad dressing","steps":"blend all ingredients together in a blender'","description":"pour this on a fresh picked bed of baby greens like arugula. top with some rich creamy cheese like a warmed blue. then top it with some toasted pine nuts! yummy!!","ingredients":"extra virgin olive oil', 'balsamic vinegar', 'lime juice', 'garlic', 'mustard', 'honey', 'dried lavender blossoms'","review":"This is an excellent recipe !
