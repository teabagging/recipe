I placed them into a full-blast oven for about 5-10 additional minutes.  Finally, the guests could wait no longer, and I served each bowl with a dollop of vanilla  bean ice cream.  The very top of these had a slight crust, while the interior was much like- well, soup.  But a beautiful, rich, chocolate soup.  I said, oh well, brought these out to my guests and said, 'here is what you have been waiting for- Schokolade Soup!  I am not sure what the correct texture should have been, although I know my oven is calibrated correctly- but these were wonderful!  I know this because all conversation immediately ceased, and one could only hear the sound of the dessert being sucked down.  A good omen, indeed.

These are very lowfat so even though the pans are nonstick, they should be sprayed well with cooking spray.

My DD saw them and said that she would never eat another store bought donut again. They made so much noise when they were eating them I was afraid that they would choke. When DD actually ate one she said that she would miss these when I was gone (as in deceased :roll:). I promised to give her the recipe before then. DS (4 yrs.) kept smacking his head. He said that he had to do it because they were so good. DH thought they were just like store bought. I give these another 5 stars because my son has food allergies and can't have donuts from most places. I put some in the freezer to see how they do. Another 5 stars because I didn't have to fry them. I didn't have coffee so I used 1T Nestle's chocolate milk syrup and 1/2 c minus 1T skim milk. The donuts were cakey and a little spongy. I thought that the slightly spongy texture might be due to the milk. But my family had no problems with that. I also couldn't find my donut pan and used a mini bundt pan instead. They looked kind of fancy. I put in about 1/4 batter and got 10 donuts. I cooked them for 10 minutes. I wasn't sure of the glaze because I only used 1T water and it was pretty thin. But it fine, it made a nice little crust on the donuts, just like the ones from a donut place. As far as points go I figured them to be 5 pts each. Thanks for a great recipe. Now I can justify the space the previously unused mini bundt pans take up.  I first rated these on Feb.21, 2008 but the stars didn't make it on."},{"name":"lil bit of sunshine","steps":"in the tallest iced tea glass you have , add ice , vodka and top off with mango sunny d', 'stir and enjoy !', 'any number of garnishes can be added - be creative especially if serving to friends', ':)'","description":"this is an extremely simple adult bevy....i found this worked and was rather tasty while visiting friends in albuquerque, nm.  availability of the classic sunny d mango flavor is hit and miss....but trust me....it's worth trying!  classic bottle....light green lid.  not the orange infused new stuff (dark blue lid).  :)  lots of friends have tried this...and chef --v asked oh, so nicely that i get it posted.  it is so nice on a hot day...sitting by the pool (or not).  very smooth and deceptively sneaky so be careful (ok, i pour a lil heavy-handed.)  i posted it with a better ratio i hope.  :)\\n\\n**note: zaar hasn't added mango sunny d to the data base yet - so just know that is what is called for.  :)","ingredients":"vodka', 'sunny delight mango flavor orange drink', 'ice'","review":"Well, my kids loved these, seeing as they contain sugar and are chocolate and mini. Also, they were pretty quick and easy to do. Mine needed closer to 12 minutes bake time in the mini pan. I like that they can be mixed up by hand without an electric mixer - the batter is thick and kind of gummy-textured so it&#039;s not exactly easy, but not difficult enough for me to lose patience with it, so definitely doable with effort. The thickness and gumminess of the batter makes it rather difficult to get into the mini donut pan neatly, as it&#039;s not pourable and clumps in the pan and sticks to the spoon when you try to distribute it evenly so the donut doesn&#039;t turn out with a lumpy bumpy top. I am glad the recipe did not make any more than 24 because I would have gotten fed up with trying to get this batter into the little cavities. I also felt that these were lacking in the flavor department, but I can appreciate the fact that they are a fairly quick easy way to delight kids with cute mini donuts without needing to deep-fry. I imagine a glaze would surely help with the taste issue, so if you are trying these I do recommend that you plan on glazing them."},{"name":"lil cheddar meatloaf","steps":"pre-heat oven to 350 degrees', 'add egg & milk ia a bowl and beat slightly', 'stir in cheese , oats , onion , green pepper , salt and oregano', 'add beef and mix well', 'shape into eight individual loaves and place in a greased 13x9x2 inch baking pan', 'combine sauce incredients , mix well and spoon over individual loaves', 'bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 45 minutes until meat is nonger pink in center'","description":"my mom gave this recipe to me and i made a few additions of my own.","ingredients":"egg', 'milk', 'cheddar cheese', 'quick oatmeal', 'onion', 'sweet bell pepper', 'salt', 'oregano', 'lean ground beef', 'ketchup', 'brown sugar', 'prepared mustard'","review":"Absolutely fabulous dark chocolate icecream recipe.

There was a lot of evaporation anyway, and the flavor was just fine, if maybe a bit weak on the oyster sauce due to the extra sherry. I only had 1 stalk of broccoli, so I added about 1 cup of cauliflower to make up the difference. It was tasty.

My gravy was rich and thick and it didn't need thickening-I loved that. For the reviewers who had too thin of a gravy, it's probably from using fresh miushrooms instead of canned-the fresh give off a ton of water.

This may be because instead of cannoli metal rings, I tried to use my rolling pin, and later the end of my metal whisk (which worked better) for shaping the cannoli shells.  Because my shells were so hard, I went ahead and stuffed them all with the ricotta mixture and by the next day the cannolis were pretty perfect.

I was out of homemade beef broth and I would only use store-bought beef broth to feed starving Armenians, so I made a quick broth using English Bovril which has an extremely intense beef flavour ? that, combined with the tomato flavour, was absolutely heavenly. I also lucked out and found very fresh herbs in the store, so I used them instead of dried.

It went together quickly and easily with ingredients that I usually have on hand.

Instead I seasoned the panko with Italian herbs, a pinch of salt with the other seasonings. I used Kraft bbq sauce. This recipe is very easy - just dredge in crumbs and bake in the oven. I have some problem with the recipe though - I couldn't taste the bbq sauce at all. Although I left the chops in the fridge for an hour or so, the crumbs didn't really 'stick' to the meat. Anyway, my bf and I did finish them off (2 pork chops; I halved the recipe) - the taste was pretty good. Thanks for posting!

Unlike another reviewer, the flavor of the barbecue sauce came through - but it wasn't too much to ruin the other flavors. I coated the chops and allowed them to refrigerate for two hours - but even after doing that when baking in the oven they didn't get crispy. So, I went ahead with spraying them with the cooking spray and broiling. Worked out great! I had some difficulty with the breading not sticking to the bottom - but other than that these were delicious.
