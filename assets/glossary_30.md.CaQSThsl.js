I started by throwing the warm water, sugar, and yeast together in the mixer to activate for 5 minutes, then added everything else. 8 minutes with the bread hoo, 1 minute of kneading and we were ready to go. plopped the dough into a bowl, covered very lightly with olive oil and the covered with a towel. waited 1 hour. Then folded dough over as recipe calls for, and waited 30 minutes. Next step, toom the dough out and cut it into 3 sections instead of 6. the dough lost a lot of its air at this step, dont be worried. did 3 oval logs and let it rest 20 minutes. then made a rectangle of each one at the size i wanted, and rolled it as the recipe calls for ( fold top on halfway, fold the bottom over top, fold it the edges, and place fold side down on the baking sheet. Once on baking sheet, flatten it down just a bit. this step is important is you want to make sandwiches. Since i didnt have a palm reed to use like a traditonal cuban style way, i placed a metal kabob stick on each roll, covered the rolls with a towel, and let them rise about 1 hr 15 minutes. once they rose again, placed them in the oven at 375 for 25 minutes. the end result was a 9.5 out of 10!!!

I added some chopped carrots too. It would be good with chunks of onion as well. The chicken seemed perfect, done in a 450 oven , I was afraid to put mine on 500. DH wasn't home until it had cooled down so I reheated it in a 350 oven uncovered after breaking it into pieces. This really dried the chicken. So serve this immediately or find a way to keep the chicken moist while re-heating. I had also drained the pan and made a sauce from the drippings with rice flour, Helmans olive oil mayonnaise (soy free) and water which was nice. Therefore there were no juices in the pan upon re-heating either. The chicken was soaked for 1 1/2 hours. I used olive oil and crushed garlic in replacement of the garlic butter and I did not leave the chicken in the fridge after removing it from soaking but dried it off. It crisped a bit but not as much as I would have liked. (Did not try cornstarch to crisp it because of allergy) I had no problem with the potatoes being too greasy because I cut off much of the extra skin. I served it with a salad on the side.

I only made 1/2 of the recipe, which still made 12 rolls, but did have to add almost a cup of extra flour, probably because I live in Florida, no altitude.  Then when it came to the filling, it was next to impossible, or at least for me, to spread the mixture out on the dough.  So I spread about 2/3 of the dough with the mixture, then just buttered the rest and sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on it.  So mine was extra rich and very sweet, but still such a huge hit with DS and his GF and then also with her DM.  Leftovers worked well to heat up in the microwave for several seconds.  Next time I would just spread the softened butter on the rolled out dough and then spread the mix of brown sugar and cinnamon on top of it.  Thanks for this great recipe, a new family favorite!!!

The first time I tried to make them, I didn't have enough lemon juice, but I had a grapefruit, so I added that in. Also, I added rosemary because I thought that would go nicely with the fruity tang of lemon and grapefruit. I think this greatly added to the recipe. Everyone who has tried them has LOVED them, even many people who aren't vegan and didn't even realize that they were vegan cookies. I want to experiment a little with the canola oil and see if replacing it with soy yogurt is better or not. In muffins, soy yogurt works really well to make them dense and creamy - that melt in your mouth feeling. I wish these cookies had a bit more of that feeling.

If you cook it until edges are brown then you get a crispy cookie. If you bake it no more than 10 mins, you will get a chewy cookie (which I prefer). My husband and 3 yo daughter loved the cookies.

Thanks Angelfan!  I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I used a regular cake pan.  That may be why it took 55 mins. to bake.  Also, it may be why the brown sugar didn't carmelize completely.  I waited a minute or two before turning the cake over onto the serving dish and the topping stuck to the pan, so I had to scrape it off the bottom of the pan and put it back on the cake.  Let's just say my cake wasn't going to win any beauty contests, but everyone loved it anyway.  Oh, also, I doubled the amount of butter and brown sugar and that also might have been why it stuck.  I did use 1/2 cup of milk & 1/4 cup of pineapple juice instead of 3/4 cup milk as suggested by another reviewer--great suggestion, it really added to the flavor of the cake.  The cake was delicious and very very moist.

I'm not at all sure that I can recall ever having eaten goose but when I think of goose I continue to be haunted by my brother's experience on picking up his Christmas goose in England and being told that the goose he was buying was Emily; and that she'd always been such a very nice little goose... knowledge which, I gather, had rather detracted from their enjoyment in eating of Emily. So I really didn't want to know the chicken's name!  Anyway, my focus was the stuffing. I was drawn to this recipe by the sheer yummy-sounding nature of the ingredients and made the full quota of the stuffing though it was clearly going to be more than one medium-sized free-range chicken could accommodate.  Just loved the wild rice, orange zest, chestnuts and herbs in this - and bacon is always a great addition to stuffings.  I also added a few drops of orange juice. Perhaps it was the act of a culinary philistine, but I did add one chopped leek and 4 cloves of minced garlic to the pan in step 6, then because I felt something was needed to bind the ingredients, I added an egg.  What didn't fit into the chicken, I placed in an ovenproof dish and cooked separately.  FABULOUS STUFFING: just loved it. and could happily eat it on its own by the spoonful.

My suggestions are to add Italian seasoning and plenty of S &amp; P and use cheese w/ some spunk....mozzarella was a little bland. Also, don't over bake the crust and the final baking time should be, as someone else commented, about 35-40 minutes.

A kitchen scale is worth its weight in gold if you want baking success that will you save you money.  Also, I used Fleischmann's bread machine yeast rapid rise from the jar.  Store yeast in the fridge but make sure it is room temperature before you start the recipe.  I used a Zo bread machine to mix the dough, make sure the water is the right temperature, add the oil - THEN the flour.  Make pockets in the flour to add the rest of the ingredients.  Make sure you have a separate pocket each for the yeast, sugar, and salt.<br/><br/>I kicked up the recipe by brushing melted butter on top of the loafs after final rise on the stove top, then sprinkled Italian seasoning, parmesian, and a wisp of garlic powder.<br/><br/>Finally, if you don't have a Hoagie bread pan, use a 9 X 13 pyrex baking dish (it has sides), make 3 loaves.  They will touch each other after rising, but - after baking, they will easily separate.  They will be loafy, soft, yet hold together.  Simply cut the bread to the size you want.<br/><br/>It took me 3 batches to figure this out!  But tonight my hubby asked me to bake these every week!  He says he will never buy Publix hoagies again!  Oh - also take them out at the right time,  these rolls will look slightly brown and will continue to cook for a couple of minutes when pulled from the oven.  Maybe that prevents crunchy.

One recommendation for those that want to make this, be sure to chop the cabbage relatively small  I left mine in long-ish strips and it made it harder to cut it into peices and the cabbage sort of dangled around off our forks.

I make these wonderful potatoes mostly at Holiday meals, but they are great anytime of the year.  We love them with baked ham.  My version of the recipe is slightly different.  The measurements and amounts are the same, but I use cubed cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta and milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2. The biggest difference is in boiling the potatoes and making the cheese sauce.  In my recipe, the potatoes are par-boiled. (Be careful to use exactly 2 c. of water.)  I DO NOT drain the water from the potatoes, instead I mix the 1/2 c. milk with the 4 Tbsp. flour and add it directly to the potatoes and water.  I then add the cheese and boil until the sauce thickens.  At this point, I season the potatoe mixture and pour it into a greased 9x13 baking dish.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 mins. or until potatoes are completely tender and cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.\\n\\nOne helpful hint from years of making these, try to use a non-stick stock pot when boiling the potates as this is also where you make the cheese sauce.  It can stick to the sides and make it tough to clean later.  I don't have a non-stick pot, but it's still worth it.  They are GREAT!!\\n\\nMy thanks to Dee for putting these recipes together for everyone to share.

These are goooooood!  Especially considering they don't have any butter or oil except for the peanut butter.  I made the recipe as stated, except I used wheat bran rather than the oat bran and applesauce rather than pumpkin puree, both of which ladypit OKed before-hand.  Worked wonderfully!  I had no problems with the dough being too thick- I thought it might even be a tad too thin, but I think this may be because of my substitution of applesauce.  I added a tad more kamut flour to compensate and thicken in up a bit (about 2 Tbs or less) which worked well.  These are very puffy and cake-like.  I used just short of half a cup each of sunflower seeds and walnuts and a couple Tbs each (to top off) of sliced almonds and pecans.  These don't have a terribly strong banana or peanut butter flavor, which is good, I was a little concerned they would be overwhelmingly flavored with one or the other- but although you can taste the peanut butter and banana, it is definitely not a strong flavor.   These really are everything cookies!  I was making BF bring me the ingredients and he kept asking me What is IN these cookies?   To which, I answered (and who could resist?), Everything!  I like that these are easy to throw together using just one bowl.  These certainly don't TASTE like they're good for you (but they are!) and who doesn't love a recipe like that.  I can't wait to make these again and try some variations like using other dried fruits, different kind of chips, adding some spices or substituting some of the honey with more molasses.

It is truly delicious - no mistaking it for a box mix or a spice cake - it is classically perfect, prize worthy!"},{"name":"broiler grilled corn","steps":"crush chipotle in mortar and pestle , or grind in a spice grinder', 'add chipotle , chili powder , cumin , cayenne , garlic powder , sugar and salt to yogurt and stir really well', 'taste for seasoning', 'each ear only gets a thin coat , so if you want it hot , add more cayenne', 'strip corn of husks and silk', 'arrange on broiler tray in a single layer', 'brush all sides with butter and broil 5 minutes', 'turn over and broil another 5 minutes', 'brush all sides with butter again', 'continue cooking and turning often until corn is golden and a few kernels are charred', 'transfer corn to a platter', 'smear each ear with about 2 tbsp of yogurt mixture , spreading evenly', 'sprinkle all over with parmesan and squeeze lime wedges over', 'eat hot'","description":"from pithy and cleaver. the vivid flavors work well, even with supermarket corn, and the broiler means you can make it even in an apartment kitchen.","ingredients":"chipotle pepper', 'chili powder', 'cumin', 'cayenne pepper', 'garlic powder', 'sugar', 'salt', 'greek yogurt', 'corn', 'butter', 'parmesan cheese', 'lime wedges'","review":"It is just OK to me.  Nothing special about it.  I did the burnt sugar thing but as soon as I added it to the batter, it got hard like candy.  It broke into little pieces but wouldn't melt into the batter.  Is there a better way to do this since the recipe didn't specify when to add the carmelized sugar.  It just says to  pour immediately into the batter but after which step of mixing the batter?  I don't know what to say since I followed the recipe exactly.  I was excited about trying this recipe out too. :("}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(o=>{const t=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return o.name.toLowerCase().includes(t)||o.steps.toLowerCase().includes(t)||o.description.toLowerCase().includes(t)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],G={key:0},R={key:1};function V(o,t,a,h,s,n){const u=p("PoemCard");return i(),r("section",null,[t[3]||(t[3]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 recipe 🥳")])],-1)),e("div",H,[t[2]||(t[2]=e("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),g(e("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":t[0]||(t[0]=l=>s.searchQuery=l),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,s.searchQuery]])]),e("div",N,[(i(!0),r(f,null,w(n.filteredPoems,(l,m)=>(i(),y(u,{key:m,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:t[1]||(t[1]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[s.isLoading?(i(),r("span",R,"Loading...")):(i(),r("span",G,"See more"))],8,P)):k("",!0)])}const F=c(B,[["render",V],["__scopeId","data-v-2296efa2"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/30.md","filePath":"glossary/30.md"}'),Y={name:"glossary/30.md"},_=Object.assign(Y,{setup(o){return(t,a)=>(i(),r("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{K as __pageData,_ as default};
