I like to cook onions, peppers or any other vegetables at a slower longer rate and the tuna, shrimp or scallops at a higher rate to insure a quick sear.\\n\\nExcellent flavor, loved it. I marinated it for 1 hr, just because it worked out to be 1 hr not planned.  Very good.  I used basmati rice flavored with jalapenos, scallions and lime and then topped with the skewers.  Tasty! Very!

We liked them.  Like another reviewer, I skewered the veggies separately to allow them to grill longer than the tuna.  We grilled the veggies about 10 minutes (after rubbing them with olive oil) and grilled the tuna skewers 2-3 minutes per side.  Even though we marinated the tuna almost 2 hours, the marinade flavors were pretty subtle.  I would say to perhaps double the marinade ingredients in order to also marinate the veggies (they seemed a little plain) or so there is plenty to give everything a good dousing after grilling them as the reserve marinade really came through when drizzling (though I quickly ran out).

I did have to make a few alterations due to on-hand limitations: my marscapone came in 8oz tubs, so I just used three of them (I was too lazy to measure out the exact 18oz and preferred having extra filling rather than less). Because of the addition of the extra marscapone, I offset that with one extra separated egg, a couple extra spoonfulls of lemon curd, and about 100mL extra cream; I didn't have any brandy or white rum around, but I did have a bottle of limoncello tucked away in the fridge, so that was my alcohol; my lemons were pretty small, so I ended up using four instead of two, but probably should've used 6, since I ran out of the dipping liquid before I was done and had to supplement with more limoncello and a bit of bottled lemon juice (okay, so the top layer of ladyfingers was a bit boozy, what of it?! lol); I didn't bother making the lemon sugar for the topping, instead, I finely crushed up some lemon drop candies and sprinkled that on top (the bright yellow of the larger pieces was very nice against the pale tiramisu).

It looked amazing especially when I made my meringue and put it on top. I baked and let sit to room temp. I was excited because I had tasted the mix while cooking and it tasted amazing! But when I sliced into my pie it was so runny! I didn't understand since it started out thick and I thought I had pretty much followed the recipe to a T. So I turned to google and I read on several pages that corn starch won't work if cooked to long. I read that I should have cooked it at 1 minute after boiling where as this recipe never gave me an exact boil time and I must have overcooked my mix ruining my starch making a runny lemon pie :( I love the flavor but don't know why it didn't set right.

This bread is incredible!  Made it exactly by the recipe, using King Arthur Bread flour the 1st time and King Arthur All Purpose the 2nd time, plus Rapid Rise Yeast both times.   It had fabulous flavor and texture.  It can also be sliced very thin for marvelous sandwiches.  Sold my two Zoji bread machines (2 mini and 1 regular size) when we moved 3 years ago but was never that happy with their output anyway and was making bread by hand till I got too lazy.  Broke down and bought a vintage Farberware bread machine at a garage sale last weekend but it had no manual so was looking for a recipe because I didn&#039;t want to wait till the manual I ordered arrived.  Really happy I stumbled on this one.  Much superior to any bread I have ever made in a bread machine and so easy.  My only problem is that it rises so high it sticks to the top of the machine and causes the bread to cave in slightly and not brown on the very top.  Looking at the King Arthur website though, I believe I need to cut the water back by a few tablespoons.  I&#039;ll try that on my 3rd loaf - we&#039;ve already finished the first 2.  If that doesn&#039;t work I will try cutting the yeast back or using regular yeast rather than the rapid rise.   Someone was asking how to store homemade bread.  I use the Debbie Meyer Breadbags from Amazon.  They are reusable and are wonderful for keeping the bread fresh and accessible.  You just stick the bread in and fold the excess under.

No more inedible crusts! This morning I really went outside my comfort zone and used this recipe as the basis for parmesan-herb-garlic-rolls. They are gorgeous! I added 2T fresh minced rosemary and oregano, (80% rosemary, 20% oregano - a little oregano goes a long way!), a full cup of fresh parmesan, and I replaced the regular salt with garlic salt, as I realized at the last minute that I didn't have fresh garlic. I also used olive oil for the oil/butter. I put the fresh herbs in my small food processor with the oil and pulsed it a few times to mince the herbs and infuse the oil. Proofed my yeast, then threw everything into the machine and let her rip! I watched a video from another website to learn how to cut and shape the rolls. They came out fantastic! I didn't even have to grease my hands to cut and shape the dough!

It was a random recipe pick.  I had never even heard of Foie Gras -much less be able to pronunce it. The more research I did into what this was, the worse it got for me. Not only had I  never heard of Foie Gras, I wouldn't have know a turnip if I fell over one.  Needless to say - with NO Enthusiasm - it took me a couple of weeks just to pull the ingredients together. \\n\\n**I never did find what I thought Foie Gras really was - but ended up getting Liverworst Pate.  I was lucky to come up with a turnip and that ended up in a package of 3 (the least I could find). Instead of Sherry Wine Vinegar, which was something else I couldn't find I used Red Wine Vinegar. After searching 4 or 5 stores in a couple of neighborhoods - those were the staples I finally settled on. I had no luck finding unsalted broth of any kind so I just used a can of Beef Broth.\\n\\nThe recipe: \\nThe recipe was easy - once I figured out what I needed, what it looked like and what to do with it. I flattened the Liverworst Pate into thin patties between wax paper. But my excitement for what was about to happen still wasn't there. As the ingredients started cooking and melding together, the aroma got interesting. By the time I added the Red wine vinegar - I found myself getting hungry!  \\n\\nWhen the time came to sear the liverworst pate - well that got interesting.  It made it into the hot frying pan ok - but when I went to turn them, the patties fell apart. No problem though  - it just made more...\\n\\nThe Conclusion: \\nWhile I went into this with a non-enthusiastic heavy heart, I was quite surprised by the outcome. It wasn't the worse meal I've made - but it wasn't the best one I've made. It was though, in the words of Herkimer - another expanding of my culinary horizons. If I never eat Foie Gras or a turnip again the rest of my life - at least I can say I bought, I cooked, I tried.\\nOh yeah... never say never!"},{"name":"homemade chocolate marshmallow cream  fluff","steps":"in a very clean glass or metal bowl , beat the egg whites & cream of tartar till light & foamy', 'w / the mixer still running , sprinkle in the 2 tbsp of sugar , cont beating till soft peaks form & set aside', 'in a sml saucepan , mix the water , corn syrup & granulated sugar together', 'cook over med heat till it boils & comes to the firm ball stage', 'do not overcook', 'drizzle the hot syrup into the egg whites w / the mixer running on low', 'turn the mixer to high & beat for 5-6 min or till the sauce is very fluffy & the consistency of marshmallow cream', 'beat in the extract & cocoa'","description":"found at preparedpantry.com, this recipe lets you take your marshmallow cream dreams a step further. suggestions for use included sandwich cookies + layer cake filling & frosting. i cannot help but think this would also be very good as a simple garnish for spec desserts & a kid-pleaser after-school snack when spread on a flour tortilla filled w/banana slices. *enjoy* (times & servings were not given & have been estimated. time for mixture to cool was not included.)","ingredients":"egg whites', 'cream of tartar', 'granulated sugar', 'water', 'light corn syrup', 'vanilla extract', 'cocoa'","review":"original recipe and description at williams-sonoma.com"},{"name":"homemade chocolate marshmallows","steps":"prepare a 9x13 pan by lining it with aluminum foil and spraying the foil liberally with nonstick cooking spray', 'place 1 / 4 cup plus 2 tbsp water in a small microwave-safe bowl , and microwave for 2 minutes', 'pour 1 / 3 cup cocoa powder over the hot water , and stir or whisk to dissolve the cocoa', 'place 1 / 2 cup cold water in the bowl of a large stand mixer', 'sprinkle the gelatin on top and stir briefly to distribute', 'let gelatin sit and dissolve for at least 5 minutes', 'spoon warm cocoa mixture into gelatin , and stir or mix on low to thoroughly combine', 'place remaining 1 / 2 cup of water , corn syrup , and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat', 'stir to dissolve the sugar , and insert a candy thermometer', 'allow the mixture to cook without stirring until it reaches 240 degrees on the thermometer', 'brush down the sides occasionally with a wet pastry brush to avoid crystallization', 'while the candy cooks , briefly run the mixer on low once or twice to ensure the gelatin and cocoa is well-mixed', 'once the candy reaches the proper temperature , remove it from the heat immediately', 'turn the mixer to low , and slowly pour the hot syrup into the mixer bowl', 'be careful , as the syrup is extremely hot', 'if you have a large liquid measuring cup with a spout , you can transfer the hot syrup to the cup before pouring to make it easier', 'gradually increase the speed of the mixer until it running on high', 'whip the marshmallow mixture for 15-20 minutes , or until it is stiff and shiny', 'you can tell it is done when you stop the mixer and lift up the beater , the marshmallow will slowly drip back down into the bowl in a thick , shiny stream', 'pour the marshmallow into the prepared pan and smooth the top', 'allow it to sit and firm up at room temperature for at least 10 hours', 'sift the powdered sugar , 4 tbsp cocoa powder , and cornstarch together', 'cover your workstation with waxed paper to protect it , and liberally sprinkle the surface with the sugar / starch mixture', 'sprinkle the top of the marshmallow with the sugar / starch coating , and flip the marshmallow face down onto the prepared surface', 'carefully peel back the foil from the marshmallow', 'spray a large smooth-bladed knife with nonstick cooking spray , and coat both sides with the coating powder', 'cut the marshmallow into squares , coating the knife blade with sugar / starch as needed', 'roll the cut edges of the marshmallows in the coating mixture so that all sides are smooth and not sticky', 'if desired , melt 12 ounces chocolate coating and dip the cut marshmallows halfway into the chocolate', 'the chocolate needs to be able to set without refrigeration so use only tempered chocolate or chocolate coating for dipping', 'to save marshmallows , store them in a dry airtight container in a temperate , dry location', 'do not refrigerate them or keep them in a very humid place', 'fresh marshmallows go stale after about a week , so these are best eaten soon after they are made'","description":"this looked so good, i had to post it here for safe keeping.  i mean what could be better than chocolate marshmallows?

I don't think roasting garlic is really worth the effort as it takes on a bitter taste. Also I can't find Angel Hair Pasta in supermarkets or Asian shops and assume it is something like rice noodles. Rice noodles are really a bit disappointing as they taste very strongly of nothing! I don't wish to decry this recipe as it really is potentially superb but - - I cheated and made a standard white sauce with butter by making a roux from butter and white flour or I could have cheated and make cornflour thickened milk sauce if I was short of time. Then added a pinch of salt. Then when it had thickened added a pinch of oregano and a few winds of the black pepper mill. Added Chopped pre-boiled red pepper - lastly a dash of white wine. The onions can be any and not necessarily red onions though I admit the red ones are sweeter and milder - could even be good with what we oldies call Spring Onions but supermarkets seem to call them Salad Onions. Not sure what &quot;Flatten tenders&quot; means? - Surely diced skinned chicken breast fillets would be fine without bashing them like a steak? I fried the chicken pieces - but (not in Olive oil as this has recently been proved to turn into the very wrong type of fat that increases body-mass but only when it's heated for cooking. It has the reverse effect when consumed cold as a salad dressing or drizzled over food.) I used Rapeseed Oil - added the onions and chopped garlic and fried until the chicken is just browning but not long enough to dark brown the garlic - The chicken pieces can be finished off under the broiler ( or as we call it in the UK the Grill). I use a microwave grill combination which cooks things on a gentle medium microwave setting at the same time as kind of spit-roasting as the turntable rotates the food under the infra red grill at the same time. Finally the chicken was put back in the thick sauce - brought to simmer and served. I served this over egg-noodles but it would also be good pepped-up with chilli powder and served on rice. The strips of bell pepper raw I had have to leave out, they may give it visual appeal but I can't eat raw bell peppers they cause violent stomach ache rather like pickled onions and raw onion does for me.
