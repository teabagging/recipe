I think cooking in sweet soda followed by a sweet barbeque sauce such as Sweet Baby Ray's was too much sweetness.  I think I would try a sauce that was spicer or smokier next time.  I was also really put off by the scum that formed while simmering the meat in the soda.  It was black and I had a hard time scraping it off before covering with the barbeque sauce.

The person that rated this as bland must have made a mistake. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made this exactly as the recipe directed.  I then purchased some mashed potatoes and gravy from Popeye&#039;s and did a taste test. Extremely close. So close that without a side-by-side comparison you can&#039;t tell the difference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some suggestions to make it even closer.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taste - this is slightly saltier, hotter and has less chicken flavor than Popeye&#039;s.  I suggest using low sodium broth and salting to taste.  Use ever so slightly less cayenne. Also add one or two tablespoons chicken base to up the chicken flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consistency - Popeye&#039;s gravy is thin. This recipe is even thinner as directed.  I chose to up the simmer time in future attempts to get the desired consistency.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wildcard - There is a subtle flavor in the original that I can&#039;t copy.  I originally thought it was a shellfish base but I added some clam juice to a recipe and it wasn&#039;t that. I finally gave up without success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except for the wildcard flavor this is a fantastic recipe.

Although this one was very similar in consistency and appearance, the flavor still tasted wayyyy different than what you get at Popeye's. Even though this recipe calls for a very small amount of vinegar, it overpowered the smell of the gravy. Before making the recipe, I purchased a small container of gravy from Popeye's so that I could compare the two side by side. When you take in the smell of the real Popeye's gravy, you smell the meat and the pepper and the spices. This recipe smelled nothing like the real thing. It is also quite a bit saltier than Popeye's, but that part could be adjusted by using low-sodium broth and either omitting the added salt or adjusting the amount to suit your taste. I am just so disappointed that I spent the money to buy the chicken gizzards and the ground pork and then still didn't turn out a final product that tasted like Popeye's.

It's very good & was perfect consistency for filling. However, we don't care for allspice, and I went ahead and followed the recipe -- big mistake. If I were to use this again, I'd leave it out. (If you like allspice, you'll be very pleased with the taste!) I was trying to recreate a recipe I saw on America's Home Cooking. Took 2 rolls of phyllo and cut them into 1/4-inch rounds, unrolled them into strips and tossed them with 1/4 cup melted butter. Put half the strips into a deep dish pie pan, covered with the cherry filling, then topped with the remaining phyllo strips. Baked for 20 minutes at 400. The top came out brown and gently crispy -- the bottom, however, was a glutinous glob. If I were to try again, I'd probably use a bigger,  casserole-type dish to spread the phyllo out more. Also put less phyllo on the bottom than on the top.

It was very flavorful. I went even further by saut&eacute;ing celery, onion, garlic, carrot, bay leaf, fresh thyme, powdered thyme, fresh rosemary and a few dashes of hot sauce and a half teaspoon of kosher salt in a mixture of butter and olive oil. When the vegetables were tender I added a whole rotisserie chicken that I deboned, removed the skin and chopped into bite sized pieces. I stirred and let cook together for about ten minutes. I then added chopped scallions and chopped fresh parsley and added the rice a few cooking spoons at a time until it was combined well. I did not use all of the rice but froze the remainder. Careful with the salt as some rotisserie chickens can be very salty. Somewhere between jambalaya, chicken bog or rice pilaf. Can be served alone for lunch with a salad, as a side or as a bed for meat or beans.

I was happy to see that when I bought my jumbo shells that this is pretty much the same recipe that Barilla has on the back of its box for jumbo stuffed shells.  The Barilla recipe adds 1/3 cup pasta water instead of the 1/2 here and it says to bake 1 cup mozzarella cheese on top of the shells--those were the only differences--both great recipes.  I used a combo of parmigiano reggiano, gruyere, and asiago cheese because I had those in my fridge but not enough of one so it was a great blend!!!  I used Mezzetta Napa Valley Bistro Tomato Basil sauce and that tasted great.  I love the nutmeg in the mix and the salt is just right.  I accidentally forgot to chop my spinach but it didn't need to be chopped, I liked the homemade look that not chopping it gave the dish. Also, I must have been really hungry because I forgot the foil and it still turned out perfect!!!   The only thing that I didn't like was that a lot of the shells went to waste. Both this and the Barilla box say to boil the entire 12 oz box of shells, which is way too many.  I ended up using about 20 shells for the filling and I had about 20 more shells left in the pot!!  So next time, I will only boil half the box, 20 - 25 shells.

Gouda, (the city, where the cheese of the same name is made) is about 40 kms from me, so there will never be any excuse for me to not find Gouda cheese for this at any time of year :) I didn't use almonds as I like pinenuts more, I used only 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar becuase I didn't want it really acidic and I made it twice, the first time with onions and the second time without and decided I liked mine better without the onions. Other reviewers are right, this doesn't have too much flavour on it's own, but on a busy buffett / salad/ or BBQ table, I thought that it was actually nice to have something that was both refreshing , tasty and fairly neutral to off-set oft accompanying marinated meats, curries and other dishes where flavour explodes and hogs the limelight. THIS dish is the perfect quiet supporting cast member that brings balance to a such a meal. The final reasons for awarding 5 stars... nice to have a salad that *isn't* doused in dressing and what a fun way to eat brocolli !!! I will be making this very often every summer from now on!

I also found the quantity of the cheese in relation to the vegetables rather on the large side. I used nearly 6 ounces which was ok, but I would have been happy with less as well.
