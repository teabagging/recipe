And be sure the oven is really hot before baking.  <br/><br/>I rest the dough between tea towels for the 30 min rise and then slide my hand under the tea towel to move the rounds onto the baking sheet, flipping them over as I do that.

I used 3 cups KA white whole wheat flour. I did add about 2 tsp honey to warm water and added the yeast to that and let it get foamy before mixing into the flour and salt (because that is how I have always done regular pitas). I have found kneading the dough at this point is good. Let rise and it easily doubled. It made 6 balls of dough for me for 6 to 7 inch pitas. I let the balls rise again while the oven heats. Rolled out GREAT (way easier than white flour ones). Puffed fine. My mistake was stacking them too soon! The bottom one got a little soggy so it is not going to pocket well. My very last one did not puff but I think that was because I took a little chunk off one to add to it to equal out the size. If you can pinch those off the dough ball as one piece then you get puff. Roll out even. Oven has to be 500, it really does or you won't get puff (even with regular wheat ones). I usually then freeze my pitas in baggies when they are cooled. They thaw out terrific. Once I get used to this recipe, am pretty confident they will be as good for pocket salads as the white ones. (Oh, and be careful not to pinch edges once you roll out. I think that also keeps them from puffing. and my cooking time is about 3:30 to 4 min at most)."},{"name":"my mom s pizza sauce","steps":"mix all ingredients together', 'do not cook', 'stores well', 'freezes well'","description":"quick and easy pizza sauce.","ingredients":"tomato puree', 'tomato sauce', 'salad oil', 'parmesan cheese', 'sugar', 'salt', 'garlic salt', 'pepper', 'oregano', 'parsley flakes'","review":"Best pita I have ever made or had.

I've had taro in restaurants before but never had prepared it at home. I remembered  hearing somewhere that you need to prepare taro correctly, otherwise you could get sick. So I googled to find out how long to boil it. I found sites that said to boil it with skins on, skins off, from 8 minutes up to 1 1/2 hours. Then there were warnings about wearing rubber gloves because some people would end up with stinging hands when peeling it. I got to the point where I was asking myself if I really wanted to make this recipe, lol. I finally found one place that said that you could microwave a small root for 4-5 minutes. So that's the way I cooked the taro, and it worked really well.<br/><br/>I made the recipe as directed from that point on, but I did change the oil/butter for each batch as it was turning an ugly color, lol. I'm really glad that I made this and it was really a great snack. The taro tasted like a nutty potato and mixed with the sweet potato and pineapple really well.

Our family and extended family all go on vacation together each summer. Everyone takes a night to cook and have dessert. This year I made this dessert. Oh my gosh...They went nuts over this! I felt especially proud when the bests cooks in the group were asking for the recipe. The only thing I changed (and it was totally on accident, but turned out really good) was that I put all the whipped cream in the mix. I forgot to separate it. It worked wonderful, and was easier in the long run. I didn't put the strawberries on top of the dessert, I just dressed each slice as I served it. Also one other thing I'll change for next time is use more Oreo cookies. I think the recipe I used asked for 10 cookies and I'd probably do at least 15, but that's because I like a thicker cookie crust. I made 2 loaf pans and decided to try to put the last two recipes in a 9x13 pan instead of two pans. It still turned out, but you have to make sure you let it set for about 10-15 minutes so it doesn't have that icee frozen sort of taste. Same with the loaves. Let them sit out for a little while before serving. It ends up being more creamy if you do (not melted so much). I quadrupled the recipe for 30 or so people and probably could have only doubled and been all gone. I'd probably triple next time instead.

Instead of self-rising flour I used regular all-purpose and added 1,5 ts of baking powder and a pinch of salt. I found that 250 g of brown sugar and 60 g of butter does not a pourable consistency make, so I added a few tablespoons of boiling water to get a sauce-like consistency. (Could be that our brown sugars are a bit different!) Then, I needed to adjust the baking time as I have a 24 cm pan - I baked the cake for 40 minutes and it was almost perfect, I'll take the cake out a tad sooner the next time! After all this, I was happy to find that the cake turned out beautifully! The sauce ends up at the bottom of the cake, moistening it on the way, and leaves a lovely crust on top that looks crunchy, but is not (hence the cake is easy to cut!). The taste of bananas, the crunchiness of the walnuts, the sweetness of the caramel sauce... Yum-my! The only thing I'll change the next time is to use less brown sugar - I think that reducing the amount of sugar but keeping the amount of butter the same will result in a pourable sauce, plus my taste buds could do with a little less sugar overall!

Takes a bit more work than I can ever do on a week day, but is a wonderful treat when I have the time."},{"name":"nana s welsh currant cookies  frying pan cookies","steps":"heat frying pan to 350f', 'beat together 2 eggs and 6 tbsps milk', 'add dry ingredients & shortening in a mixing bowl , blend well', 'add egg and milk mixture to dry ingredients , stir until well mixed', 'place plastic on bowl to cover dough & chill dough in refrigerator about 2 hours', 'on floured board , roll dough in 4 parts to 1 / 4 thickness', 'cut shapes with floured glass or cookie cutter', 'fry in electric fry pan until golden'","description":"these are wonderful cookies and i have fond memories of making them with her and sharing a cup of tea.","ingredients":"flour', 'baking powder', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'nutmeg', 'sugar', 'raisins', 'shortening', 'milk', 'eggs'","review":"I have been meaning to review this for a while. I have made this several times and it's great! Just what I was looking for. There is a place in Chicago that serves this and it's my favorite. Chicago is about 3 hours away so needless to say it's a rare treat. Not anymore! I invite my mother in law and her brother over when I make this and they love it, too. I love nutmeg so I add a little extra. I have also used fat free half and half and it's still wonderful! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!<br/>Update!!!<br/>I just wanted to update my review because I have made some changes over the past few years using this recipe. I have to say that I'm so happy that I have found this recipe. It is wonderful. So for my changes, I no longer add egg to the bechamel sauce. I found that the sauce gets thick enough without the egg. I also cut down on the amount of butter and flour. I use 3 tablespoons of butter and flour. I use the same amount of liquid, but use whole milk with a little cream added. Maybe 2 cups of WM and 1 cup of HC. I also like to add grated Parmesan cheese to the sauce. It's still rich and creamy without all that butter. That's about all I do differently. One person said they thought it was bland, but I don't think that at all. If you season each component of the dish and salt your pasta water, you will get a very savory dish."},{"name":"nana s white chili","steps":"sautee onions and garlic in butter and evoo', 'add the rest of ingredients , minus the corn', 'cook until simmering , then add corn', 'continue to cook until hot and bubbly', 'best if reheated', 'lasts 2 weeks refrigerated'","description":"yummy chili given to me by a friend.  thanks to her nana for feeding my picky family of 5!","ingredients":"yellow onion', 'garlic cloves', 'butter', 'extra virgin olive oil', 'chicken broth', 'chicken', 'white beans', 'corn', 'diced green chilies', 'lemon pepper', 'cumin seed', 'ground cumin', 'oregano', 'dried cilantro', 'lime juice', 'olives'","review":"A tasty vegetable casserole!

For those who think they didn't come out brown enough, I will tell you that when Pizza Hut makes these (I was a General Manager there for several years), prior to these going in the oven they are brushed with liquid butter oil.  I'm sure that helps them with the browning process.  Also, unless someone orders these and they've just been taken out of the oven, they're reheated in a toaster oven that has a conveyor belt.  This would also aid in browning.  If you want them browner than they're turning out for you, I would suggest at the end, to turn your oven up higher or even to the broil setting for a minute.  That should help.  The topping isn't sprinkled on  (at Pizza Hut, feel free to follow this recipe as posted, I'm just giving some info) until they come out of the oven and after they've once again been brushed with butter.

Part of the confusion stems from the mention of bulbs (plural) while the recipe itself called for just one head.  I ended up quartering the head and removing the  core from each piece to create a small canal in which to place the filling.  The filling itself was good, a nice combination of bright flavorful vegetables. The soy-brown sugar combination added a nice flavor but it did overpower the other flavors.  Were I to make this again, I would reduce each by half.   While I liked the fennel and stuffing as separate components, the flavors did not marry well together.  (We actually used some of the stuffing with zucchini which has a far more neutral flavor and that worked very nicely.) So much creativity here.
