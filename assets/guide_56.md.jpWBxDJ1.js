This is hands down the BEST way to make saut&eacute;ed mushrooms. Over the years I have developed lots of changes like less oil and butter, different liquids and herbs but what makes this recipe is the TECHNIQUE shared here. Leave mushrooms WHOLE! Slicing them will allow them to just release a lot if liquid and steam rather than saut&eacute;ed properly. Put them cap side down in a hot pan with enough oil to coat the surface with a light layer of oil. Relax! They may (will) stick but Do NOT TOUCH until they are super carmelized. They will release once the Maiilard reaction has taken place. Don't know what that is? Learn here. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction That is the secret key here! Excellent recipe.

I'll be sharing it with friends and family!!"},{"name":"mexican chicken cutlets","steps":"pound chicken between wax paper to 1 / 4 inch thick', 'in small cup , combine chili powder , salt , cumin , and cayenne', 'sprinkle over both sides of chicken', 'in large skillet , heat oil over medium-high heat', 'cook chicken 2 to 3 minutes per side , until cooked through', 'set aside', 'combine mayonnaise , lime peel , salsa and pepper', 'serve mayonnaise mixture on the side as a dipping sauce for the cutlets'","description":"these are very nice with a side of spanish rice and some sliced tomatoes and avocados. we sometimes have them on toasted buns with monterey jack cheese for really good sandwich.","ingredients":"boneless skinless chicken breasts', 'chili powder', 'salt', 'ground cumin', 'cayenne', 'vegetable oil', 'mayonnaise', 'lime zest', 'chunky salsa', 'fresh ground pepper'","review":"Just a few thoughts - stir a few times while cooking and when the rice is the right texture cover and move to a warming oven until ready to eat.

However, I would do a couple things differently next time...first, I would not cook it on high. The rice got so crusty and black on the edges that a good portion of it was inedible. Secondly, I would not pour the rice/milk mixture OVER the chicken--I would place the chicken on TOP of the rice mixture. Here is why--when I started to dig out the rice and the chicken pieces, the chicken was so moist that it just started to fall apart. In a short while I was unable to tell where the chicken ended and the rice began, and I ended up stirring it all together into a sort of casserole. It tasted fabulous, but there were a lot of bones to pick out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I should say that I did not follow the recipe exactly, as I did not have either of the soups. Instead, I used 2 big onions chopped and carmelized, and I added 1/2 cup heavy cream, and then a generous portion of dried basil and dried thyme and 2 bay leaves. Another thing I did was brown the chicken before putting it in the crock-pot (I always brown my meat because it adds a lot of flavor).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One more thing is that this recipe kinda needs some color!"},{"name":"mexican chicken enchiladas  restaurant style","steps":"place thawed chicken into a 7-10 qt pot', 'pour fresh water into pot until the water covers all the chicken + 6 inches more of water', 'place pot on burner', 'put in the 5 bay leaves , 3 tbsp garlic , 1 / 2 of a onion , 2 1 / 2 tsp salt , 1 tbsp red pepper flakes', 'boil on medium-high for 1 hour 20 min or until chicken falls off bone easily', 'once chicken is cooked , place into a very large bowl', 'place in fridge for 20 min to cool down for easy handling', 'while cooling down , drain half the broth and boil the rest uncovered', 'take chicken out of fridge , begin shredding apart each piece by hand , discarding fat , bones , and knuckles', 'make sure you have discarded all of the bones and knuckles', 'add the lettuce , 2 whole chopped onions , 1 1 / 2 c pepper jack and 1 1 / 2 c colby jack cheese , powdered garlic , pepper , salt , chili powder , 1 can olives', 'mix until well incorperated', 'set aside', 'spray lightly 3 13x9 inch pans with cooking spray', 'pour in all enchilada sauce into pot with boiled broth , mix , turn down heat to medium-low', 'get another person to assist you', 'place and single corn tortilla on a wide spatula , place lightly into sauce , leave in no more than 5 seconds', 'place tortilla into greased pan , fill with 1 / 4 c chicken mixture , roll up as tightly as you can without tearing', 'repeat process until all tortillas and pans are used', 'make sure each enchilada is place tightly , and close to eachother', 'pour remaining sauce , cheese , and olives all over prepared enchiladas , cover with tin foil', 'place in oven at 350 f for 35 min , broil hi the last 5 minutes uncovered', 'cool , uncovered for 10 minutes', 'serve with sour cream , salsa , green onions'","description":"i have had many different variations of enchiladas...but this is by far the best  enchilada as it gets for me. my mother has been making it for years, she got this recipe from her hispanic brother in law. this is to feed a very large group or family.. it is well worth the time and effort....i promise.","ingredients":"chicken wings', 'bay leaves', 'garlic', 'onion', 'salt', 'red pepper flakes', 'head of lettuce', 'onions', 'monterey jack pepper cheese', 'colby-monterey jack cheese', 'garlic powder', 'ground black pepper', 'chili powder', 'olives', 'enchilada sauce', 'corn tortillas'","review":"I used a can of Cream of Chicken and a can of Broccoli Cheese, both the healthy version since that was what I had on hand.

In the early 1990s, tomatoes and tomato-based products were spotlighted as potentially preventive. In studies conducted at Harvard, 48,000 health professionals were followed for 6 years and monitored for evidence of prostate cancer. Researchers read the results to suggest that lycopene might decrease the risk of prostate cancer, whereas other dietary antioxidants, including beta-carotene, appeared to have no effect. In an observational study in Italy, tomatoes (a diet staple) had been consumed in significantly lower quantities before their illness by patients suffering from colorectal and other digestive tract cancers than by the healthy control group.\\n\\nIn a study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina, an association between heart health and tomatoes was seen. Fat samples drawn from heart attack sufferers and healthy controls were analyzed for lycopene and other carotenoids. There was significantly more lycopene in the fat of the controls than the heart patients. The diet of the controls was also higher in tomato products, suggesting that a lycopene-rich diet may have protected them against heart disease.\\n\\nThe method of tomato preparation seems to affect lycopene absorption. In a German study, researchers found that the lycopene blood levels were higher after ingestion of a heat-processed tomato product than after consuming uncooked tomatoes. The heat apparently disrupts the cell structure of the tomato, making the lycopene more available. Caution is indicated, however, against extracting lycopene or any compound from tomatoes and administering it separately; tomatoes are rich in vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and other phytochemicals that may work together to exert these effects."},{"name":"mexican jack cheese omelet","steps":"gratein a blender , cook in skillet , & fold into omelet'","description":"an omelet with a bit of a spice to it!","ingredients":"eggs', 'monterey jack pepper cheese', 'milk', 'salt and pepper'","review":"Pretty good.

I made a few changes. My grocery store is very unpredictable and I couldn't get ground pork this week so I used turkey.

I used Cento brand whole plum tomatoes since they are my favorite and just broke them apart with my hands as I dropped them in. I also used fresh herbs from my garden and lots of them and one large onion rather than the 2. I made this Sunday and then placed it in the fridge for Tuesday's dinner. Not b4 a taste tho, and I was very happy with that taste. We enjoyed the meal tho next time I think I will serve it the day I make it. Some sauces are better fresh others better after sitting. I think this (as most of this type) is better fresh. I now have the leftover sauce (enough for another full meal) in the freezer.

This is a very rich dish that would probably be great after a day of outdoor activity in the cold. I made a few bite-sized - I think I would serve it again that way, as a hot sakad or appetizer. I was uncertain whether the chilled cheese mixture needed to warm before cooking, so I tried a range of temperatures. It seems best midway between chilled and room temperature, so that the cheese heats up in the oil, but doesn't liquify. I just pan-fried and turned the croquettes when one side was done. I just used the whites for dredging, not whole eggs. There was more than plenty liquid - that could just be 2 whites and less milk.

I think I looked at the sauce recipe & expected an Asian taste but the cinnamon in the filling was overpowering & created more of an Indian flavor.  It didn't seem like too much cinnamon when reading the ingredients but for my family's taste it turned out to be.  I think it made the rolls a little too sweet for us.  I was also excited to bake the egg rolls instead of frying them but it turned out that we didn't like the texture baking provided.  The rolls were tough on the inside & greasy on the outside (even after draining on paper towels).  The dipping sauce had a nice amount of heat to it & I enjoyed that, but the overall flavor just didn't appeal to us.  And the texture was thick, like a paste.  I may try this again as the things we didn't like are all personal preference, nothing wrong with the recipe.

I&#039;m giving this 5 stars just for that, but I think the ingredient amounts may be a little off.  I used 2 boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into 4 slices each, the total weight was 450 gm., and that was 2 generous dinner sized portions.  The egg amount is way too high, I used one XL egg and 2T vinegar, and only needed half of that.  I did add some Nu-Salt to that mixture.  I used 4 oz. of Lay&#039;s Salt and Vinegar chips crrushed fairly finely (I used a Zip Lock Freezer Bag and a rolling pin), which is less than the amount the recipe calls for.  Being salt conscious for my husbands&#039; dietary needs, this works out to 200 mg sodium from the chips, which is not excessive for his needs, and there was no more sodium added except for the amount in the chicken and the egg. Note: the nutritional chart does not include the chips, so it is misleading.  For the vinegar I used a malt vinegar, and since the vinegar flavor was fairly light, next time I may try cider vinegar.  I also may try misting vinegar over the top before baking, hopefully that won&#039;t cause sogginess.  I cooked mine in a convection oven at 400 degreees F for 30 minutes, and I did not turn them.  They were crispy and a nice golden brown.

i have included instructions on how to do this below.\\nyou could also use valencia oranges in this recipe, if you wish.\\nthe sugar is added after the liquid has been reduced for two reasons:\\nthe peel must be cooked until it is thoroughly soft, and if the sugar is added at the beginning of the cooking it will have a hardening effect on the peel. also, adding the sugar after the liquid has been reduced produces a fresher-tasting marmalade, because the sugar does not cook for a long time and begin to caramelize. however, if you prefer a darker, more caramelized marmalade, and don't mind the rind being a bit chewy, go ahead and add the sugar at the beginning of the cooking process (i.e. the marmalade cooking process, not the juice cooking process).\\nthis is an old fashioned recipe which takes at least 2 days, due to the soaking. it is not quick, but it is delicious.","ingredients":"meyer lemon', 'navel oranges', 'sugar', 'lemon juice'","review":"These are such a perfect side.
