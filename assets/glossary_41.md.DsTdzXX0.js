And after 83 reviews you sure do not even need my comments! I found this recipe because I we eat broccoli often and I do get tired of the usual ways of preparing it. I used walnut oil, because I really need to use up my precious walnut oil, It does not have a strong flavour. I think I used a goodly bit more oil than in your recipe. The part about browning -- at whatever heat -- did not quite work for me. It threatened to burn. Some of the sliced stems turned brown, but I was not able to do that with the florets. I also added, like some said, garlic -- in my case, the dried ground type. I used the flaky sea salt, Maldon. The end result, which I let get just enough cooked so I could pierce with a fork, was nice, perfectly pleasant, but not different enough from lightly steamed broccoli to merit 5 stars. That said -- I might often, in future, resort to frying my broccoli!!! SO in that sense you converted me. I also think that a slightly thickened lemon sauce would be great with this (but I already had a lemon-herb sauce on my chicken, so didn't try that). In the photo I added lots of flat-leaved parsley, because I happen to have a patch which is now knee-length and needs to be used!!

Of course I used the grilling option!\\nNow, as per Queen Bergy's add on, I added some chopped up mushrooms to the onions and pepper mix and fried them all up. I used HP sauce and began heating. Then I had a glass of wine ..... ummmm .... and promptly forgot about the stuff on the stovetop! The HP and veggie mix cooked on my range for I don't know how long!

Even with all the eggs in it, it came out creamy, cheesy (not at all bland) and perfect.  At my husband's request, I put it in a baking dish, sprinkled over some buttered fresh breadcrumbs and ran it under the broiler.

I loved all the meat in this dish they all mixed together so nicely. When I made this casserole I used 9 slices of bacon as I had an extra piece to use up. I did use the onion. I could only find 8oz bags of pepperoni so I used a couple of stacks. I could only find 6oz of canadian bacon so I just used that. I started with the 8oz of sauce but I thought the pasta was to dry so I added a whole 15oz can of pizza sauce. Still thought the pasta was dry so I added a 8oz can of tomato sauce. I didn't have Italian herb seasoning so end up using 1 tsp Italian seasoning. I couldn't find shredded montery jack but I did find a 8oz bag of of Kraft mild cheddar & monterey jack cheese so I used that. Overall this was pretty easy and pretty fast.

Like Mirj, another reviewer I used orange flower water rather than the rose water though I think it's not traditional in Indian Kheer we prefer it. I added additional cardamom pods per preference and took them out before serving. I left out the nutmeg both because we don't consume any intoxicant and because I think that's not traditional in Indian rice pudding.

You just have to boil it a lot longer and add more water a couple of times. When I used to eat this soup at Bill Knapps, I thought the beans were larger. I wonder if the great northern beans are closer to what the restaurant used. Either way, this soup was amazing. Your results will vary depending on the kind of ham you use. I used smoked ham.

As a sardine lover, I just loved the sound of this blend of ingredients with the sardines but what I was wanting was a tasty appetiser for six, not 120 hors d'oeuvres!  I had checked first that my guests liked sardines, as I'm well aware that not everyone does!  Instead of cutting the bread into so many little triangles, I used six whole bread slices of rye bread.  I used nearly double the quantity of sardines, added 1 clove of minced garlic to the minced onion, used slightly more mayonnaise and added some lemon zest and a small sprinkling of dried thyme in with the sardine mixture in step 4.  They were in the oven for 15-20 minutes. I served them with some more parsley sprinkled on top. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Bev!  There just aren't lots of sardine recipes around, and I was SO pleased to find this one. Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders."},{"name":"cheezy hot and spicy bagels   good morning","steps":"mix 1 , 8 oz size of premium cream cheese , 1 / 4 cup chopped jalapeo peppers and a teaspoon or more of tabasco or franksred hot sauce', 'mix well on sliced bagel half spread mixture , cover the bagel with a slice of mozzarella cheese pop it in the microwave for 30-60 seconds we have also baked in toaster over for great results'","description":"","ingredients":"bagel', 'cream cheese', 'mozzarella cheese', 'jalapeno pepper', frank's red hot sauce]","review":"I followed the recipe except I left the slices of bread whole because I was preparing it for lunch for DH and me.
