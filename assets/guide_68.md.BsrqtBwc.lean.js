That would tell it all. :) This bread is absolutely wonderful. Not at all hot, but very flavourful. I halved the recipe to make one loaf, and I'm glad I did. Boy is this sucker *BIG*. I actually measured it, and it's 10-1/2 inches in diameter. Taste fantastic cold too. YUM! I used Robin Hood Multi-Grain Flour and 1 package of 'quick-rise' yeast. I also used a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes instead of the pepper sauce. Gave it a nice fleck along with the jalapenos and bread grains. The sesame seeds were a great addition. Next time I make this...and there will be a next time, I'm going to half the dough to make two loaves, and try freezing one. The only disappointing part was that with all the cheese chunks, I'd have thought there would have been more cheese 'pockets'. Maybe I need bigger chunks. :) I served this with my recipe #219776. It made for a great meal. Thanks Kittencal for another wonderful recipe. UPDATE: Aug 11/08: Made the full recipe this time, and divided the dough into 4 pieces.

Perhaps it needs some fresh chives or green onions, or maybe a bit of extra sharp cheddar, but still, this made a very good bread that rose well and made large loaves.  To anyone preparing to make this bread, be sure to use bread flour, not all-purpose, and don't worry about the dough being too sticky before the cheese goes in.

I believe this is the second cheesecake I&#039;ve made that was actually baked.  He was thrilled and I was too.  My pans were 7, 8 and 10 inches so what to use when it called for 9&quot;.  So, I went with the 8&quot; thinking that the 10&quot; might be too large.  I don&#039;t think this would have been the case.  I thought I poured plenty of the cheesecake part in the pan and still had a ton left.  So, I quick whipped up some more base and actually got a 7&quot; and 8&quot; out of the one recipe and it was plenty thick.  Now I will say I think I could have used a little more of the cool whip/sour cream topping and I did mix up just shy of another batch of the graham crumbs but otherwise, was plenty for the two sizes.  I can&#039;t imagine how thick it would have been in one 10&quot;.  Regardless, delicious and quite simple as well.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  Always a challenge to make a new recipe for someone when you don&#039;t know what it will taste like.  Oh, I also mixed up a little blueberry sauce and drizzled it on top for color and I used frozen blueberries for the whole thing.

The crust is yummy too, shortbread like. The only thing I do different is add more lemon rind. I add it to the crust also. The mistakes I've made are: adding more lemon juice because I didn't want to waste it, which made it soupy & it didn't work by doubling it in a 13x9, darn. These bars are delicious, try them!

Amazingly, these turned out well, baking for 20 minutes in my oven.

I did NOT make the custard but used the usual 2 pkgs of french vanilla pudding (and 4 cups of milk rather than the 3 most call for).  But I did use the recipe part for the stabilized whipped cream (unflavored gelatin and whipping cream) instructions and used the topping.  I thought the topping really was yucky and really ruined the whole cake.  I used semisweet chocolate chips as I read the original (on the site) recipe and it used semisweet chocoate.  It definitely was NOT what I had tasted in other eclair cakes.  It looked pretty (i.e. glossy) but just to me ruined the cake&#039;s &quot;eclair&quot; taste.

I chose to use dried beans rather than canned and that's where my problems began... I allowed the beans to cook too long and they turned to mush. The end product looked more like hummous, but it still tasted good! I did add more lemon juice since beans require a good amount of salt anyway, I figured, well, rather use more lemon juice than more salt. Also snipped off some fresh sage from my herb garden which means this was a very inexpensive meal to prepare. Served over steamed short grain brown rice, but next time I will: use canned beans (or at least watch the bean cooking process more diligently), buy tomatoes from the farmers' market, and serve the beans over whole wheat pasta.

The next day this was so yummy cold!  I substituted 2 cups diced fresh vine tomatoes for the can of diced tomatoes.  Since I really wanted the fresh raw tomatoes, I added the beans to the sauteed garlic and sage for a brief minute and then added all of that to the raw tomatoes & lemon juice in a large bowl.  I liked the use of fresh tomatoes, however, next time I will take care to drain them better and increase the sage to 3 tablespoons as the fresh tomatoes & juice kept raw drowned out the sage flavor a bit and I would have preferred more.  It was great served with tuna salad.  Thanks for posting!

Hearty enough for a vegetarian main course, improves the next day, and it's good warm or cold.  I added a diced onion in addition to the garlic, and I increased the sage substantially because I wanted that to be the keynote flavor.  (But be a bit careful, too much sage can add a bitter note.  So I began with about 3 T fresh sage, sauteed with the garlic and onions, then added another T. near the end of the cooking.)  This dish is very forgiving-- you can used canned or fresh tomatoes and beans, but I think the fresh sage is key for a true Tuscan Fagioli.  Try it over polenta of any type.  When I'm in a rush, I just broil a few slices of that precooked polenta-in-a-tube  (Trader Joes) and top with this dish.
