All these great reviews but this turned out awful for me. I really am wondering if something is missing in the recipe? Some other reviewer had remarked that the mixture seemed really dry, so she drizzled with oil. I took that advice, but it did not help. It was like eating sawdust! There is really nothing in this recipe except Italian seasoned bread crumbs, garlic, and Romano cheese. So where is the moisture? I used pre-grated in store Romano cheese from Meat Farms. It was a bit drier than the Locatelli brand I usually buy. But Romano is not much of a melting cheese, its usually used as a dry spaghetti topping. So where was the &quot;bubbly&quot; . supposed to come from? If this were mozzarella or some other soft cheese the bubbling would come from the melting cheese, but hard grating cheese did not melt. I see one of the reviewers pictures had sliced melted cheese on top, but the recipe did not call for it. I would be willing to try this recipe again, if someone cold explain why I ended up with the dry ingredients as dry as when the went in the oven? One thing I should note is that the mushrooms I used were purchased stemless, so I did not add any.. I doubt adding them would have caused any moist bubbling anyway.."},{"name":"mini banana chip muffins","steps":"in a large mixing bowl , cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy', 'add the eggs , one at a time , beating well after each addition', 'beat in vanilla', 'combine the flour , baking powder , baking soda and salt', 'add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream , stirring until just combined', 'stir in sliced bananas and chocolate chips', 'spoon into greased muffin top tins or mini muffin tins and bake at 350 degree oven for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean', 'cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely', 'enjoy'","description":"my kids always wondered why i kept the banana's after they started turning dark brown.  now they know why!  i make muffin tops out of them.  these tasty morsels seem to disappear faster than i can make them.","ingredients":"butter', 'sugar', 'eggs', 'vanilla extract', 'bananas', 'whole grain wheat flour', 'baking powder', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'light sour cream', 'mini chocolate chip'","review":"Since I had no clue what a Snag is I had to try this recipe.

I then put it in the microwave to stay warm. For our pasta we went with linguine, and for our mushrooms I chose a mix of crimini and shiitakes. I used more like 4 cups of mushrooms. While the pasta was cooking I sauteed the mushrooms up in some of the leftover bacon grease mixed with a little garlic flavored olive oil, and threw in about a T. of margarine for good measure! Then when it came time to add the EVOO, I instead added some white wine to moisten (1/4 cup) and a T. of evoo, but honestly I would probably leave the evoo out next time as it wasn't needed. And finally since both stores I went to during our grocery shopping were out of fresh basil, I ended up using that fresh basil paste instead and it worked out well. I would add more capers next time since I really like them, but that is personal preference. And I really liked the extra something the hot pepper flakes added to the dish.

Since there are only two of us here, we had a lot left over. As good as it was, I thought it could use a little something. I had a quart container of it leftover. I mixed up 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, 2 teaspoons sugar, 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and poured over the leftovers in the quart container, put the lid back on and shook it up to coat it entirely.

Then, I poured the sauce over the cops and increased the temperature.  I watched them closely, so as not to allow them to burn (due to the honey and ketchup).

As per another reviewers suggestion I used dark soy sauce as I don't like things too salty - this was perfect and any more salty I would not have been able to bear.  I also cooked the wings for about 20 min before adding the sauce, to avoid the fat swimming issues that other reviewers had.  40 min after adding the sauce it just wasn't thickening and I was getting a bit bored and hungry to say the least, so I mixed a paste with some cornflour and a little water and mixed that into the sauce (having put the wings in a bowl momentarily) ....added the wings back in and returned to the oven for another 10min on 200 degrees c.  On returning to the oven I Found the sauce had thickened and caramelised into a lovely thick jam like consistency and then stirred the wings around in this with a large slotted spoon to get them all coated in it.  Then sprinkled on the sesame seeds.    I would recommend leaving them for at least 5-10 min before putting anywhere near your mouth as the sauce is scorching and takes a while to cool due to the hot sugar.  They were a fantastic hit with my boyfriend and am now planning to try next time with ribs.

My husband and so enjoyed the chicken! Unfortunately I only had 2 lbs. of chicken on hand to use in this recipe, and after my husband and I ate the 2 lbs., I wished I&#039;d of had the 3 lbs. of chicken. When I was mixing the ingredients, I used a low sodium soy sauce which I purchased at Festival Foods. The brand was Essential Everyday, and it only had 580 mg of sodium in it. I didn&#039;t add any salt, but I did use 2 cloves of garlic (minced). I did lightly grease the baking pan, before adding the chicken and the sauce, and I baked the chicken for 30 minutes, then flipped it over, and continued baking for another 30 minutes. And it was perfectly done and caramelized within the hour. I would bake as per the instructions, but just be sure to turn the chicken over after the first 30 minutes of baking. By the way I wanted to mention, while the chicken was baking away in the oven, my whole house smelled absolutely wonderful, kind&#039;a like Chicken Teriyaki. I will definitely be making this chicken again! Thank you Theresa/Thunderbird for sharing this recipe.

The cake was moist and really very-nicely flavoured.  Two small changes that I don't think compromised the integrity of the recipe.  I can't get coconut extract in Greece, so I used almond extract.  I realize the cake had less 'tropical' flavour but it was, nonetheless, delicious.  Also, my mango was really, REALLY ripe, and did not cut nicely, so I decided to puree it.  Worked out fine but probably lent a slightly darker appearance to the cake.  I decided to bake it like one of my pound cakes, seeing as no temperature was indicated.  I do my cakes at a very low oven temperature, 160C-320F, and my cake took 70 minutes to test 'toothpick clean' at this temp.  I did have to tent it for atleast the last 20 minutes of baking with aluminum foil, as the poster suggested.
