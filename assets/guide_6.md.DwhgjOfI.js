One could say they are connoisseurs as they are very picky on the type and add-ins for the potatoes.  I was a little nervous trying this but because I was going to be under a time crunch for preparation, I decided to give it a whirl.  First off, I didn't tell anyone I was doing anything different to see if I could get a reaction.  I didn't want to taint their views by knowing they are trying a new recipe.  I just put it out there just like every year.  They were delicious!!  Making them in the crock pot is brilliant as these are always the last thing I prepare for any meal.  Using the crock pot enables me to prepare them ahead of time and then not take time away from the guests/family right before meal time.  I prepared them the night before exactly as written in the recipe.  The next morning, I plugged in the crock pot.  I was afraid they might be dry so I added a thin layer of chicken broth (about 1/2 inch) on top.  As the potatoes warmed, I stirred in the broth. I would caution those who aren't onion/chive fans.  This has a strong onion flavor.  If you rather not have the onion, just use plain cream cheese.<br/><br/>This is our new staple for mashed potatoes.

This was SPECTACULAR!  The chicken was unbelievably tender and seasoned perfectly. I made chicken strips cut from breasts. Followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the garlic powder the 1/2 tsp (personal taste preference).  Don't miss letting the chicken sit for a while after breading. I had NO problem with the breading falling off but I think that was due to letting it sit like instructed.  I marinated the cut chicken in the liquid mixture for a couple of hours in the fridge before breading and frying.  That also might have made a difference with the breading staying on.  Some have mentioned taste being bland.  I disagree as we thought the taste was perfect.  Follow the directions exactly but remember everyone has their own preferences with taste.

I used 5 boneless skinless chicken thighs (so I left off the last 2 T of flour and cornstarch), and followed the recipe with the exception of substitutuing the seasoned salt, which I was out of, with a cumin blend mixture I always keeep on hand (chili powder, cumin, a little cayenne, granulated garlic and onion, a salt-parsley blend, etc).  It took 8 minutes in about 2 inches of oil on medium heat to reach 185 degrees on the instant thermometer.  I used a 99% fat-free condensed chicken soup and let the chicken sit on a rack after dredging, for an hour or so at room temperature.  The coating adhered nicely, crisped up beautifully and the chicken was nice and moist inside.  The skinless thighs worked perfectlly, I see no need to use a thigh with the skin on for this recipe (usually I find it helps keep the chicken moist, but it's not needed here!).  I often oven fry chicken, and I think I may try that with this recipe as some reviewers did, just to make it a little healthier.  This is a keeper recipe for sure!   Update:  I did this recipe again with 4 very large bone-in thighs, following the seasonings exactly but subbing cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken.  I browned in the oil over med-high heat for 8-10 minutes, then removed to pan with a rack and baked at 350 for 45 minutes, to an internal temperature of 180, and it was also excellent prepared this way with the big bone-in thighs.

Choose these because they were fairly low in sugar and virtually fat free. Did a little tinkering and the results were pleasing. Thought it would be worth posting my notes so that others might be encouraged to try these and do a little improvising as well. Based on the comments of the previos reviewer, I too decided to make half the batch with corn flakes the other half with rice crispies.  I whipped the eggs for both together with a pinch of cream of tartar and them just short of soft peak stage.  I reduced the sugar added to 1/2 cup simply out of personal preference. At this point I split the egg whites into two bowls.  Added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extact to the portion I mixed with corn flakes and 2 tablespoon cocoa to the portion mixed with rice crispies.  Since the volume  was much smaller than the corn flakes, I added an extra 1/2 cup (2 1/2 c. total) for the rice crispies half.  Baked both for 15 minutes.  Next time I would bake the crispies version a minute or so less. Both were very good. In the case of the corn flake cookies, they were best fully cooled when the cereal regained some tooth and wasno longer soft.  My guess is these would not work as well if you made the cookies larger as the egg whites would not properly cook.

Started peeling my onions and they were spoiled so I used onion powder and gave it a good shake. Added the first 1/2 cup of broth and let that cook out stirring the potatoes often. After the second 1/2 cup of broth I put a lid on the skillet and that worked like a charm. The potatoes started to mash on their own as I was stirring them and a really nice caramelized colored was on the potatoes. The final cup of broth and green onions went in and again I covered the skillet with the lid. These were awesome potatoes and my DH enjoyed them a lot too! Thanks Pat for another keeper!

To increase the coconut flavor next time, I might try using coconut milk in place of regular.

I modified this quite a bit. I only made about a half batch, and made it in a medium sized frying-type pan. I used about 1/4 of a sweet onion and a garlic clove, and cooked that for a while, and then added maybe 1/2 cup of water, and added a chicken bouillon cube, and tilted the pan so there'd be enough water to surround the cube so it would dissolve. Then, when the cube was dissolved, I put in 1/2 package of spinach, and warmed that up, and then I added maybe 3 oz of already cooked couscous (leftovers that I had put in the freezer).

Being from Indiana, having this as our state pie, and having grandparents who would make it from scratch I should know. Hoosier Pie (sugar cream pie, desperation pie) does not contain eggs. It&#039;s a mix of sugar and cream and uses flour to thicken the mix.While this might be good, this is not labeled correctly and should be renamed. Personally I think this one is too temperamental because it contains eggs. Sugar cream pie is supposed to be more forgiving than this is. To get the lovely golden brown, marbled texture that a sugar cream pie has we back it high for a little, then drop the temp down for the rest of the time.

This cake will register as a recipe on my favourite list, I've fallen in love with it.  :) It helps that I've always loved milk, too.  Thank you for this recipe!  It goes without saying that I certainly intend to make this again, very soon :)"},{"name":"dump swiss steak  oamc","steps":"cut steaks into portion sized pieces', 'combine all ingredients together in a gallon ziploc bag', 'freeze at this stage , if desired', 'transfer to baking dish , bake covered at 350 for 1 hours', 'serve over mashed potatoes'","description":"we adapted this to make it super easy for oamc and freezing. the portions are for 2-3 servings each because it fits really well in a gallon ziploc bag. you could double it and it would probably still fit. freezes very well. plan to make two sets and you'll use up your packages of ingredients. \\n\\nupdated to add: works well in crockpot - cook on low 6-8 hours.  i'm sure it would work great from frozen as well.\\nalso, i've used plain onion soup mix and the taste is still great.","ingredients":"round steak', 'diced tomatoes', 'beef and onion soup mix', 'brown gravy mix', 'mashed potatoes'","review":"I love this cake and make it all the time.

And it's very easy and fast. I made this for a birthday cake; baked on the day before in a 8 square pan, split into 2 layers brushed with syrup before storing in fridge. I also used 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. Absolutely wonderful! Filled with chocolate filling, and frosted with cindy lynn's white frosting (7min frosting). It was beautiful! thanks for the recipe. NOTE: i made a mistake not reading recipe properly - i added the milk mixture first before folding the flour into the wet ingredients.

You've got great recipes, Zenith!  This is my first experience with a sponge cake as well (I think maybe even my first experience eating one as well as making one) and with the exception of a complete disaster with my frosting attempt (ended up glazing it with a loganberry glaze) it was a very good one.  The cake is light and spongey, very delecate.  I, like WaterMelon, baked it in an 8x8 pan with no problem at all.  It's a lovely little golden cake and its amazing how rich it tastes considering its only got a couple eggs, lowfat (I used 2% rather than skim) milk and a tsp of butter!  It was also very easy (I like anything that doesn't require me to cream or melt a ton of butter) and I will definitely be making this again.  I also imagine that the butter melting/milk heating process could be done in the microwave (which I may do next time).
