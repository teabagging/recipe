I've made these many times.  I usually quadruple the recipe because I like to have leftovers to freeze.  These make a wonderful on-the-go breakfast for kids, too.  When I make them for the kids, I like to add some vanilla extract, Splenda, and sprinkle with a few semi-sweet chocolate chips while they are cooking.  They remind me of a chocolate chip cookie when done this way--but MUCH better for you!  Might make a good cookie substitute for dieters.  This pancake recipe has always held together very well for me. Instead of using only egg whites, I always use half the number of whole eggs.  Just make sure you have the heat turned up high enough when you cook them, and they should flip over very easily.  I have made several versions of these pancakes, including a blueberry version by blending in a few berries and Splenda with the mix.

I found this recipe by searching for the two ingredients I knew I had: chickpeas and rice.  I always have spices on hand so this a great recipe to try.  I had to make a few substitutions though.  I used 5min white rice instead of basmati.  I didn't have parsley so I left it out, and I didn't have tomatoes so that was left out too (I cannot wait to try it with though!)  It seems like a lot of spices, but oh my goodness, it is SO GREAT!  I squeezed a little lemon juice just for a tang and because I love lemons.  I was hesitant about the cheese, but it ended up binding everything together nicely.  I used the full amount of butter and oil because those tend to make things taste more hearty.  This will feed me for a few days, which is great because this is an inexpensive meal that is PACKED with flavor.  I cracked open a bottle of white wine and felt gourmet, and all of this came from rice and chickpeas.  Mmmm.  Will be making this again often!<br/><br/>I'm vegetarian, but this would be an excellent, easy, quick dish for a potluck or as a side with chicken.  I would also consider putting white wine in with this dish in place of oil/butter, which I will try next time.<br/><br/>Maybe as a suggestion, use a little less salt.  The salt kind of overpowered everything after a few spoonfuls.  The other spices make that amount of salt a little unnecessary.  Maybe half the salt and more lemon :)  Just my preference though!"},{"name":"chicken lasagne","steps":"combine cream cheese , soups , milk and stir over low heat', 'add the chicken', 'layer: soup', 'noodles , cheese , repeat', 'bake at 350 for 30 minutes'","description":"i have not tried this recipe. i got it from pinching your pennies.","ingredients":"cooked chicken', 'cream cheese', 'cream of chicken soup', 'cream of mushroom soup', 'mozzarella cheese', 'lasagna noodles', 'milk', 'sour cream'","review":"Loved it!

First, to use tinned tomatoes and tinned beans is wrong.  Start with dried red (not red kidney) or black beans and any of the small tomatoes, vine ripened.  Soak the beans overnight in distilled water or rain water, four cups water to one cup beans.  This gives you enough water to cook rice with the beans.  Use chopped cilantro and celeray leaves instead of parsley, and fresh-squeezed lime juice instead of lemon. Use red habenero peppers, either the Jamaican Red or the hotter Scots Bonnet (my favourite!!!)  If you can't get fresh habenero, you can use Marie Sharpe's Fiery Hot sauce, which is available in many supermarkets in the US and UK. And the coconut milk must be from a fresh coconut.  None of that tinned stuff is any good.  Do not boil the beans.  Bring up to a simmer and after about an hour and a half to two hours add brown rice.  Cover tightly, reduce heat, and cook another hour.  Serve with stewed chicken, fried plantain, and potato salad.  With these small adjustments you will have true tropical rice and beans. \\nRichard Merrill, Belmopan, Belize\\nI forgot something.  Your original recipe does not include two essential ingredients.  Garlic and Onion!

I've been searching for healthy recipes to make ahead and freeze this winter. I'm not big on meatloaf but for some reason this recipe caught my eye. (Maybe it was the bacon.) <br/><br/>I doubled the amount of meat, because it seemed like the meat to veg/bread crumb ratio was a bit off. This probably wasn't necessary, but I enjoyed the meatier texture. I also doubled the bread crumbs, and used just under two eggs. (I dislike an eggy meatloaf.) <br/><br/>I pre-cooked the bacon just a bit to render off some of the fat, and that seemed to work well. I was also sure to not over mix the ingredients. <br/><br/>It turned out fantastic! My version made four large burger-like loaves. The larger size meant I had to use two pieces of bacon (BACON!!!) for each one. It also meant adding about seven additional minutes to the cooking time.  <br/><br/>I am very picky, and I really enjoyed this recipe. Can't wait to try it from the freezer.

I used butternut and sweetpotato instead of eggplant, added the zest and juice of one lime, doubled the coconut cream but used light coconut milk to keep the calories and fat down and because I LOVE fresh coriander added more.

Caramels are one of the things I've tried to make that never turned out right so I figured I'd give these a try. The first batch I forgot to line my pan with foil which was a bad, bad thing because they stuck to the pan and wouldn't come out at all. They also didn't set up enough. So I made a second batch, remembering to line the pan with foil (and sprayed the foil with non-stick spray) and I microwaved it for 8 minutes. The second batch was much better! I sprinkled half the pan with coarse sea salt as I love salted caramels. My only regret with the second batch is that I didn't realize till after making it that we were out of waxed & parchment paper so I had no way to wrap them up. I just put them in our candy dish. So now of course they're all stuck together. These are definitely worth trying; I'd suggest following the recipe as written for the first batch and then tweak the cooking time as needed from there to get them set up the way you like. Oh - the recipe doesn't state what size pan to use either; the first batch I used a 9x13 pan and the caramels were too thin so the second batch I used a 7x11 pan and they're still a bit thin for my preferences but acceptable at this thickness."},{"name":"chicken or beef flavored brown rice using pampered chef s rice c","steps":"add all the ingredients into the rice cooker plus , microwave on high for 10 minutes', 'stir', 'then microwave at half power for 20 minutes', 'let sit for 5 minutes after cooking , then fluff with fork and serve'","description":"my first attempt at brown rice in pampered chef's rice cooker was crunchy, so i added more water and got good rice.\\n\\nthe rice i had did not have microwave instructions, and i didn't want to start buying a different brand and that is why i am adding this so i can look up how i got it to work.\\n\\nif you make your own stock you can probably use that in place of the water, and leave the stock cubes out. i just used what i had on hand.","ingredients":"brown rice', 'water', 'butter', 'chicken'","review":"I have to jump on the 5 star band wagon.
