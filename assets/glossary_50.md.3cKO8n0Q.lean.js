I also accidentally used a different mix--brown gravy mix as opposed to the onion, but it tasted wonderful nonetheless. I&#039;ve made recipes combining cream of mushroom soup with onion soup mix, and I think I like this one better! The gravy had wonderful flavor, and the cube steaks were very tender. I did do a few things differently--I browned the steaks in a large skillet with some sliced fresh mushrooms, foregoing the crock pot only because I had lots of dishes already, and didn&#039;t want to make more. Lol  While they were browning, I combined the soup with the gravy mix and water, and upon noticing it wasn&#039;t onion gravy, added a few tablespoons of dried minced onions. When the steaks were browned, I poured the gravy mixture into the skillet, covered it, set it to &quot;simmer&quot;, and then let it do its thing for about 2 hours. The result was yummy! I also only had a pound of cube steaks, but prepared and used the entire amount of gravy. (Recommended.) Or, if you do have the two pounds, you may want to double the sauce if you&#039;re serving with mashed potatoes, noodles, dumplings, or fries, etc. I served ours with American cheese and potato pierogies, ladling the luscious gravy over all. But we could have used even more, since as it cooks, the gravy tends to thicken, and reduce to some extent. Next time I&#039;ll try it with the onion gravy mix, and transfer the cube steaks to the crock pot. Thank you Southern Chef, for sharing your recipe!

One thing to note, depending on your crock pot, you may want to keep an eye on the meat starting around 4 or 5 hours--as I have found that the roast can actually be finished by then.  8 hours is usually too long and will dry it out, even with all the juices.

So here goes again.  I love all the key ingredients in this recipe so my expectations of loving it were indeed high.  I felt, however, that (to meet our taste preferences) it would benefit from a couple of additions which would add further variation to the flavour and texture.  I added 3 Granny Smith apples (peeled and sliced to the same thickness as the potatoes), 1/2 a cup of chopped pecans, a flat teaspoon of brown sugar (just the teeniest amount) and sprinklings of cinnamon.  I added some of each of these between each layer.  As I'm usually one who who considerably reduces or omits sugar in recipes, it was with some ambivalence that I added it here, but it seemed such a natural pairing with the apple and cinnamon.  The end result: absolutely fabulous.  We thoroughly enjoyed this dish and would happily eat it as a vegetarian main course dish so I will certainly be making it again - often.  And next time, for variation, I'm going to use walnuts.  I'm also going to sneak in a liitle wine, perhaps by adding 1/2 a tablespoon to the leeks while they're cooking.  For the moment, however, I'm happy that we have several additional serves in the freezer!

I have never had albacore tuna steaks before, but bf has been craving them for weeks, and we got lucky today during our shopping trip and found albacore steak on sale (half-price!).  My package was 3 1-inch thick steaks (wild caught) equaling just under 1 lb.  I kept the sauce ingreds the same and it was the perfect amount of marinade and sauce.  I used what I had on hand but was able to stick to the recipe from tart to finish (light soy sauce and reg soy sauce b/c I ran out of the light, red pepper flakes b/c no hot chili oil just sweet chili sauce, and jarred, minced garlic for the fresh).  My ex-roomie left her George Foreman behind (small one), but no instructions, so I found this recipe doing a search on RZ.  My bf really liked the sauce and gives this 4 stars.  He's not a fan of cilantro unless it's part of the ingreds mixed in.  If it's a garnish, he won't eat it.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce/marinade and thought the cilantro added nicely to the dish as a whole. I served the steaks whole b/c when I tried to slice them, they fell apart. This is definitely a keeper, simple, quick, delicious and flavorful.  Thank you so much for sharing this!  Made for My-3-Chefs June 2008 for my Swimmin' with the Fish theme.  Btw, i expected this to have a fishy flavor to it, like other tuna or white fish, but it was sooo mild, more so than i expected.  I'm very pick about fish and love non-fishy tasting fish! Lol!

Moving on to the wet ingredients, the amount given wasn't even close to being enough. I ended up using 3/4 cup of milk and it was still pretty stiff with that much but at the same time quite sticky. I patted and cut 7 scones (not 14) and the dough was used up. I had tasted a pinch on the dough before cutting and it would benefited from 1/3 (or more if you like sweet) cup of sugar or Splenda being added to the flour mix. In an effort to help them out I washed the tops with egg white and covered them heavily with sugar. In baking I watched them like a hawk and removed them as soon as they were ready.

I needed a sugar free coconut pudding for a desert but I could not find it at the stores.  And as I wanted to use canned coconut milk to try to bump up the coconut flavor, I did not do your recipe exactly. I make these comments for anyone else who wishes to try using canned coconut milk and have it be sugar free.  I used 14 ounces of canned coconut milk (not the stuff you make drinks with) and used half and half to make up the rest of the 4 cups of milk.  I used half and half as that was what I had on hand, I replaced the sugar with Splenda and I reconstituted unsweetened coconut in a hot  Splenda simple syrup.  Otherwise, I followed everything else you had written in your recipe.   The pudding was the perfect texture very and easy to put together, It was a bit too strong in salt.

Drain and set aside. Or just drain canned corn and set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.\\tStart the potatoes for the topping. Put them in a large pot with enough water to cover them by a couple of inches. Add about 2 teaspoons of salt to the water. Bring the potatoes to a boil, uncovered, over high heat. Cook them for 10 to 13 minutes. Meanwhile, make the veggie meat filling. &lt;br/&gt;3.\\tMelt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut&eacute; the onion and celery in the butter, stirring often, for about 5 to 6 minutes. &lt;br/&gt;4.\\tAdd the veggie meat to the pan and break it up with a wooden spoon as it browns. Stir the garlic and flour into the veggie meat mixture. Stir in the No Beef Base, then the canned tomatoes, then the herbs, reserved corn, and Worcestershire sauce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.\\tGently simmer the mixture for several minutes, partially covered, then add salt (1/4 teaspoon, give or take a little) and pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture to a large buttered casserole. Set the oven to 400&deg;, and while it heats, check to see if your boiling potatoes are done. &lt;br/&gt;6.\\tTo test the potatoes, use a slotted spoon to transfer a cube from the water to a cutting board and allow it to cool for 30 seconds or so. If you can slice through the chunk easily with a butter knife, the potatoes are done. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7.\\tSet a large colander in the sink and drain the potatoes in it (this job can generate a lot of steam, so it is best done by an adult or under adult supervision). Transfer the drained potatoes to a large mixing bowl and scatter the butter pieces over them. Spoon the sour cream here and there over the hot potatoes as well. Wait a bit for the butter to melt and the sour cream to warm so the ingredients will be easier to blend, then partially mash the potatoes with a hand masher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8.\\tSwitch to an electric mixer set at medium speed and continue to mash, adding enough milk ?or cream--to make medium-soft mashed potatoes. Don&#039;t make them too soft, however; you want them to have some body. &lt;br/&gt;9.\\tSalt the potatoes to taste and spoon them evenly over the filling. Sprinkle the cheese over the top, then sprinkle on some paprika (be sure to wash your hands right afterward so you don&#039;t accidentally rub any of the spice in your eyes). Bake the pie on the center oven rack for about 20 minutes, until the top is golden brown.

I am a cheese fanatic and I loved this cheesy mix on the eggs. I used one egg with 2 egg whites and I used ricotta rather than the cottage cheese. I also used Co-Jack and bumped it up to 1/4 cup. It's a rich mixture but the veggies balance it nicely. I didn't have any spinach so I just used broccoli and it was delicious. By the way, I only needed to saute my veggies for about 2 minutes & the cheese mix warmed after about a minute. I also kept the broccoli on the side rather than throwing it into the cheese mix and I liked it that way. A unique omelet that's very good.

Ive actually been making something very similar to C yet quite different from C this recipe for years.  The proportions of potatoes to eggs are quite different: Ive used considerably less potato and rather more egg.  Ive added garlic in with the potatoes when they were first added to the pan; and once the beaten eggs (to which Ive added herbs) were poured over the potatoes and have begun to set, Ive usually added a handful of grated cheese; then stuck the pan under the grill for a minute or two.  This dish Ive always called a chip omelet!  love4culinarys Eggs n' Potatoes recipe: much the same ingredients, VERY different final result!  Except for adding chopped garlic with the onion into the pan with the finely diced potatoes, and then adding some oregano in with the eggs, I made this dish exactly according to love 4culinarys ratio of potato to eggs and according to her instructions, which were very clear and easy to follow.   I used eggs not egg substitutes.  And the end result was an absolutely delicious potato dish: suitable as a side dish, as a light meal at any time of day and as Dreamgoddess son suggested as a great breakfast dish.

I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white, sucanat instead of white sugar, 3Tbs cocoa powder plus 1Tbs butter for each ounce unsweetened chocolate called for and used 1/2 cup butter (which includes the 2 tbs butter for the chocolate substitute) and 1/3 cup canola oil.  But, like I said, none of that, in my experience, would effect the final outcome of the recipe.  Here's my qualm- its quite dry.  I like the wheat germ flavor (and you're right, it does have LOTS of that), but the bottom layer in particular is crumbly and dry.  I was worried when I pressed it into the pan, but figured I would go ahead as directed and have faith in the recipe.  Truth be told, it holds together better now than it did before it was cooked, which is good, but its still so very dry.  The brownie layer is pretty dry too- at least as far as brownies go.

I have an old, beloved, and much-used recipe of my own, written in a cookery scrapbook, and could not find it. So I turned to Zaar. This was the one which suited me best. It's great, Karen!!! I used a popular light SA beer, and all I changed was that I used more cornstarch -- not a whole lot, but more than in the recipe, and as a result a little more beer. I used tiny zucchinis with the blossoms still on, thin slices of eggplant (brinjal, we call it!), and thick pieces of stem from Pak Choi. Worked a treat. I agree - do not overmix, not even when mixing in the beaten egg whites. Mine still had little egg white bits in the final mixture, and the batter popped up beautifully in the hot oil. I used my wok with maybe 2 of oil, as I dislike deep frying. I used wads of kitchen paper to drain the batches on.

We had a Dinner party party last night, with 10 guests. Like always, sometimes stupid me, decided to try a new recipe. Lucky for us for the Tempura, decided to make a test batch first, before I did the 4 lbs of Large shrimp, and the Veggies in it. I should have looked at the pics first, not tempura. Cooked a couple of shrimp and a few veggies, started over with a real tempura batter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The batter was more like a batter you would use if your making something like sweet and sour pork or chicken. Actually it might work very well for that. I followed the recipe to a tee, didn&#039;t understand the egg or the cornstarch, but did it anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do have a really good tempura batter, that I use a couple of times a month, and never fails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway the dinner came out great, Tempura, Steak, Rice, Fruit, and a few bottles of beer.  I did save the batter until later and chopped a bunch of the veggies, some smaller shrimp I had added some spices and bean sprouts and made little pancakes out of them. They came out good. But all and all its a batter that is more suited to a chinese type meal than a japanese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One other point, when you make tempura, make sure the oil is almost at the smoking point, and the batter is Ice cold, when you place a few pieces at a time in the oil. Also if you use really good fresh seafood and veggies, don&#039;t season the batter, let the natural flavors come through. The dipping sauces are for flavoriny if you need additional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry Karen,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just didn&#039;t like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peace Out,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frank and Spanky"},{"name":"chocolate chip date nut squares","steps":"in medium bowl mix 1 1 / 2 c boiling water and 1 1 / 2 tsp baking soda with the dates', 'set aside to cool', 'beat together margarine , 1 c sugar and eggs in large bowl', 'to this add vanilla extract and date mixture', 'add flour , 3 / 4 tsp baking soda and salt', 'pour into greased and floured 13x9 pan', 'sprinkle 1 / 4 c sugar , nuts and chocolate morsels on top', 'bake @ 325 degrees 45 minutes', 'the difficult part: set aside until the next day to eat'","description":"got this from my mother-in-law. if she had told me ahead of time there were dates in this i may never have tried it. mmmmm good\\nsecret: must be prepared day ahead.","ingredients":"dates', 'baking soda', 'margarine', 'sugar', 'eggs', 'vanilla extract', 'flour', 'salt', 'walnuts', 'chocolate chips'","review":"This is not tempura batter.\\nIt&#039;s a regular batter that does not combine in making sense for the griedients in this recipie.

However, if I can manage to find a sausage that DH & I can both eat (nigh-impossible for kielbasa-type sausages), I think I'd love this dish. I'm not penalizing the recipe rating for the flavor of the sausage.
