I just found that there were too many strong flavours fighting for attention.

I love peanut butter an chocolate together, so this flavor combo was a dream for me. I also loved the soft cream cheese filling (I used the equivalent of 6 ounces of light cream cheese), it made them even richer than they already were! Both layers were easy to spread over the crumbs. I used the stated amount of crumbs and did not have any problems with it not covering the bottom. I made a quarter recipe in a loaf pan lined with parchment, so I could easily lift it out. I did not have any problems cutting them this way (I also let them come to room temperature as well). If you do, you can carefully peel it from the parchment paper.

Also, the directions didn't say what to do with the penne, so I tossed it with the veggie mixture when it was about done cooking, then served that alongside the chicken breast (I used 3 boneless skinless breasts).

It's been so yucky and rainy outside that I felt like making a crockpot meal. This was really easy to whip together before going to work, and it made the house smell so yummy while it was cooking! I don't really have time to grocery shop during the week (only on weekends), so pantry limitations forced some substitutions. I didn't have a roast, but I had 1 lb of ground turkey and 1 lb of ground beef in the freezer (it was very good with just the ground meats, but I'd like to try it again some time when a roast is available). I didn't have canned pinto beans, but I had roman beans (slightly tougher skins, but very similar). No canned green beans, but I had frozen ones. Mom and Gram have a tough time digesting too much corn, so I only used one can. I had some leftover boiled baby yukon gold potatoes, so I cut them and added them in place of the raw potato. My can of chicken broth was only 10 oz.,so I supplemented it with some reconstituted beef stock paste. Oh, and Dad, who is notoriously picky about meats (ESPECIALLY frozen ground meats), was watching me make it, so I had to brown the meat with a few splashes of Maggi seasoning and some garlic-and-herb Mrs. Dash before adding it to the pot (I just drained it and stirred it in once cooked). Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. I know, it's a lot of substitutions, but I still think that spirit of the as-written recipe was retained.

(Trust me when I say, do NOT double the amount of beans especially if you soak them over night.:)  There's another black bean recipe review going up after this one!)  <br/>I used onion powder, no red onion; I used 2 15oz cans no salt added tomato sauce; 2 lg Tbls minced garlic in olive oil; 7oz can diced green chilies; 4 Tbls chili powder; 3 Tbls  cumin (we love it); 2 tsp dried Mexican oregano.  It's completely different than standard dried oregano.  I added a very healthy amount of fresh ground black pepper and 2-3 good shakes of the cayenne bottle.  We enjoy heat.  I didn't salt it because we really try to cut way back, hence the heaping on of other spices, but I goofed and not paying attention, I bought the regular version of beef broth vs lower or no sodium. I used about 3 cups of the broth and 4 cups water, since I was doubling the recipe.  I browned the meat in about 2 Tbls olive oil on about 2-3 sides of each cube with a bit of sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Tossed it and the rest of the ingredients into a 6qt crock pot and set it on high for approx 6 hours,only because I forgot about it.  It then cooked for about another 3 hours on low and my oh my!  I'm so glad I cooked it that long on high, because it made the meat ultra tender, the beans were perfectly cooked without being mushy and the flavor is robust!  Even without creaming or blending some of the beans for a thicker broth, the 'gravy' of this chili is nice and thickened without being dry.  I added a bit of chicken broth when I heated up a bowl of leftovers, thinking it looked thick and it didn't need it.  Once heated it was just as if not better tasting than yesterday.  My husband and I had it last night for dinner over some steamed brown rice, and today, I skillet fried some whole kernel corn, drained from a can, (no salt added) in 1 Tbls of butter and browned it nicely and added a few tablespoons of corn to a bowl of the beans.

Having just completed an Indian cooking course I wanted to make this straight away. I used drumsticks instead of a whole chicken. I also upped the spices - using about 3T of ginger & 1T of garlic paste (tastes better if you make it yourself), 1T coriander seeds, 2 bay leaves, 6 cardamom, 1T each of coriander & cumin powders, 2T of garam masala, & the equivalent of 1 & 1/2 chili peppers. Don't think that the garlic & ginger paste will be overpowering, if you saute it on very low the flavour is very mellow. Before reviewing I checked with Sandeep to see whether the recipe as published was as he would have cooked, he has said that he toned the spices down for international tastes. I also used tinned tomatoes instead of fresh, as it is winter here now and the fresh ones are disgusting. Anyway, the taste was amazing, beautiful spices blending into a pleasant (but not overpowering heat). This is by far the best Kadhai Chicken I have had. I served this with raita & my tutor's chapati recipe (which I've posted on zaar). This is a fantastic recipe & I know I will make it again and again.
