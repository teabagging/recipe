After trying to make 2 calazones and them falling apart, I finally placed one circle of dough in the bottom of a greased casserole dish.  I then spooned in the filling & two broken calazones.  I finished it up by topping with the final circle of dough.  It baked up into a very tasty casserole.  I loved the use of the basil in the biscuit like crust.   It made something  ordinary stand out.  The taste of the filling was very good also.  DH & I both thought this   was a good use of contest ingredients and are glad we tried this dish.

However, we felt that the taste was overwhelmed by the amount of barbecue sauce to the point of not tasting the chicken or mushrooms.  Also, I had a lot of problems dealing with the dough.  I found it very sticky and needed some flour just to work with it.  If I made an 8-inch circle, the dough could not support the filling and just fell apart upon moving.  Also, these calzones are very large and we felt too big meal.  I think they would do better as a smaller size.

The dough was nice to work with because I placed the dough ingredients  into my bread machine put it on the bread cycle and removed it when I had the filling ready to go, but I found it doughy and a bit to much basil. I guess I \`m used to a yeast dough with calzones. I did bake them on a greased cookie sheet pan for 20 minutes. I wish I though to give the dough a milk or egg wash and sprinkle with coarse salt before baking. The filling well enjoyed the dough was a bit disappointing.But a very easy recipe to make.

I roughly quartered the recipe (DH and I really didn't need 16 servings of anything sitting in the fridge, lol). I used flap meat for the beef, and I omitted the bacon because I didn't have any, but I tried to make up for the missing bacon by seasoning the beef with some hickory bacon salt (and a bit of Adobo seasoning, but that had nothing to do with the bacon flavor). I chopped the onion and the serranos rather than slice them, because DH won't eat the veggies if they're cut in too big pieces. There were still distinct pieces of the chiles, tomatoes and onions in the cooked sauce, but they were small and very soft, and most of the tomato had broken down into a liquid (a good thing, because that's how DH prefers it :) ) . I didn't seed my 4 serranos because I don't usually, and we don't mind the little bit of extra heat, either. This was spicy, but not searingly so. I served this with cheesy pinto beans (refried pintos mixed with a packaged blend of queso quesadilla, queso asadero, queso gallego, queso anejo enchilado and manchego) and sliced avocado on the side.

But I tweaked the recipe a little.  White sugar is bogus no matter how you cut it.  So I substituted organic brown sugar for the white refined crud. I'm just not a bourbon drinker either, so I substituted 8 yr old rum for the bourbon/brandy.  And I didn't use just any plain old eggs, I used cage free organic eggs high in Omega 3 from chickens raised on a vegetarian diet, and sourced from a local farm (lucky enough to have plenty of local dairy in this area), which basically reduces the risk of anything happening with raw eggs down to nil, as they come from very happy, healthy hens.  In contrast with the other reviewer here, I thought the alcohol was a little underpowered, so I added about 2 more shot glasses worth of rum. Bourbon may be stronger, I have no idea so it may have needed just a bit extra because it was rum, not sure. I'd say start with the recipe recommendations, and then adjust to your own taste.

I've tried fennel once or twice and was not enamoured by it (I'm being polite, I hated it the previous two times I had it), but on both occasions it had been cooked and this (raw) salad use of it looked interesting. To be completely honest I'm sitting on the fence, I'm not yet in love with fennel so liked this a lot but in very small quantities, and that would usually earn a recipe three stars under my rating system, BUT considering that I actually didn't like fennel at all before this recipe, that means that this recipe has really opened my eyes to something new that I'd pretty well rejected before. (thus earning 4 stars). I will persevere with fennel, albeit in small doses and see if it grows on me further. I REALLY liked that the fennel was less overpowering here, mixed with the tomato, olives etc, helped to blend flavours. You can also tweek this recipe and add more of less of the bits you like most,  it's very fresh tasting, packs a zing and is light in taste and texture. As per my rating system I always give a recipe the benefit of the doubt and the higher of two ratings if there differing opinions/reasons. A super recipe if you already love fennel, and a good one to start you off if you are not sure.

These have a wonderful orangey flavor and are nice and moist and tender.   And healthy too?  Gotta love it!  I made a few subs- I had no oat bran, so I used all wheat bran instead; I subbed whole wheat pastry flour for the white (although I think that you would be fine using regular whole wheat in these too); I used an organic valencia orange rather than a navel (be sure to seed it!); substitued the brown sugar with Sucanat (in essence, organic natural brown sugar) and I didn't have golden rasins on hand, so I used monukka raisins instead (they're just regular black raisins, really, with a fancy name).  I flaked and pretty much pureed the orange, but it turned out just fine!  Great, great muffins.  Next time I will try dried cranberries instead of the raisins, as orange and cranberries go so well together.  Maybe add some spices (cinnamon, for sure, would be great in these) or nuts.  Perhaps some vanilla extract or orange blossom water (I have a big bottle that I'm trying to use)  I followed PaulaG's lead and filled my muffin cups very full, because you're right- these don't rise much.  I only got 10 muffins for a half recipe.  Really terrific- such a sunny citrus flavor!  Oh!  I would HIGHLY recommend that anyone who makes this makes it a point to use organic oranges- citrus is one of the foods most highly sprayed with pesticides, and since you're eating the peel in this recipe, you really ought to be careful!

These IMPRESSED our double birthday party crowd, kids and adults alike, all 43 of them!.. ok, discount the 1 baby LOL. I did however need to take some drastic action because I didn't bargain on the difference a small substitution would make. I can't get peppermint Extract here, but did have some imported peppermint ESSENCE... First I added the recommended 1 Tablespoon, and couldn't taste the peppermint at all and needed to add another two tablesppons to make this taste pepperminty enough. The result of this was a very liquid mixture with the condensed milk so I needed an additional two and a half cups of icing sugar to make it anywhere near a firm dough form. After that I used a small wine bottle top to press out the circles and it made zillions of them LOL... Mine turned out small and fatter and extactly bite sized. I dried them overnight under a clean tea towel after drying them for 2 hours  and turning them over, and the next morning they dipped like a dream... considering I'm a messy dipper LOL. If you are using ESSENCE instead of Extract I would *strongly recommend* not using the entire amount of the 14oz condensed milk to compensate for the extra liquid that the essence will make, or halve the recipe becuase I got at least 90 of my small ones from only *half* the mixture I ended up having. Guess what are the Birthday Treats Bags? LOL. That said, I would make these again in heartbeat, they are so well received and people here were amazed that I made them myself and the recipe was demanded several times.

I was wrong about that one.  I made these closer to York pattie size and they were way too large.  Some of them stuck together and the chocolate coating chipped off.  On top of that, the peppermint was very strong and it  overwhelmed the chocolate.  To compensate, I quartered them, redipped them, and pretended I'd done it on purpose.

I'm not a big fan of Peppermint Patties but those in my family that are (and that is the whole reason I made them in the first place), say that these are better than York's because the chocolate to peppermint ratio can be controlled to an individual's likings. I like to dry out the discs for a nice long time and then fridge them so that they are nice and hard before I coat them. In addition to fridging the discs, I find that the thicker I cut them, the more they look like the real deal. Depending on who I'm making them fore, I coat once, cool and then dip again.
