I will definitely make these again, but would almost mince the apples, so I get some in every bite and then would sprinkle the top with the pecans and then just use a shaker of cinnamon/sugar to put a light coating on top, as this was a bit much for me as a topping.

They turned out AMAZING and that's saying something, because I bake a lot of bread.  These are really, really good and very easy in my kitchenaid.  I knew I had a winner on my hands when I was making them into plops and they were raising almost as soon as they hit the pan.  One easy way to do the plops is to divide the dough in half and use a pizza cutter to divide up the dough.  Also, mine didn't quite get done in the middle. UPDATE:  I make this recipe a lot and, after much experimentation, I divide into 24 rolls and bake in TWO 9 pans for 15 minutes.  I cover with foil for about the last 7-10 minutes so they don't overbrown.  Also, I use powdered milk in these and it works GREAT!  There's no taste difference, it's cheaper, and it's quicker because I can skip heating the milk. I just throw the powder in with the water and yeast.

Actually, I substituted Becel Light for the butter, and it worked out really well!  That, along with skim milk brought the calories to 121 per bun, for those interested.  (I put this in as a recipe on myfitnesspal.com, and it worked out the nutritional facts for me.  I used 8 cups of flour for the recipe).

Also found sunflower seeds to be way to expensive and too large an amount no small inexpensive packages available , so I subed with sliced almonds I had on hand. It was a nice variation of cottage pie and the cayenne gave it a little zip.

I had cream, no half and half, so used 1 cup cream and 2 cups milk. We used maple syrup instead of topping with powdered sugar. My kids loved this so much. Yesterday, I made it again using apples instead of blueberries. It too, was yummy. I used 6 cups of Granny Smith apples and sprinkled them with about 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Next time I will use a softer apple as they held their texture too well and we would have liked it better a little less crunchy.

I did substitute yam for sweet potato and fresh chopped pineapple for crushed, so I was a little concerned that I wouldn't have enough liquid.

I finally raised the heat to medium low and finally medium, just being careful to keep stirring. I finally stopped at 180F by the candy thermometer, when the mixture was like modelling clay, pulling away from the bottom and sides when I stirred. (I couldn't figure how to measure soft ball by dropping in water, since there was so much yam and pineapple fiber.) I did still have pineapple chunks, so I just cut the almonds in half and made sort of dulce clusters.

THESE ARE THE BEST STUFFED PEPPERS EVER! I have been making this recipe for a few years since finding it here. I've probably made it half a dozen times in a crockpot, but last time I didn't have the time to wait so I used a large cast iron dutch oven (6.5 quart round). From start to finish it probably took 75 minutes. Instead of using 3 peppers cut in half, I had a load of small green bell peppers from a local farm, so I stuffed about 10 or 11 of them (as many as I could fit in the pot) with the meat mixture and only had enough left for about 3 meatballs, so I just divided it up and added evenly to each pepper. Then I poured in the V-8 and the rest of the ingredients as directed, except for garlic pepper, which I don't have and probably will never buy. I also sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar on top, which I think was a good idea. I realized after I removed the lid that I probably could have put less of the meat into each pepper because they expand, but they still came out great. This recipe is so much better than any tomato soup and cheese version out there. I can't recommend it highly enough.
