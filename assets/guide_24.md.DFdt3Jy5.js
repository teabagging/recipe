Thought I would post the recipe because it is so well liked. Actually, my husband just walked in and said, 'what are you doing, trying to improve on your awesome banana pudding?!' The recipe I use calls for the classic vanilla wafers and uses 3 cups of milk instead of 2. But, I am definitely going to try the chessman cookies next time. When I want to 'dress up' this dessert a little I use a trifle bowl instead of the 9 by 13. It is always a hit. Oh yeah, I also suggest to make it many hours ahead or the night before.

This looks so yummy! I made this recipe last night to take to a work picnic tomorrow. I cannot WAIT to try it!

I made my husband lick the spoon that I stirred everything with and he said MMMM. He's my tester of new recipes. It was hard to keep my daughter away from the cookies so I saved her a few....5 or so! That's it...the rest went into the recipe. I lined the bottom of the 13 x 9 pan with the 1st bag of cookies (whole); when I topped the pudding with the 2nd bag, I put them into a food processor and made crumbs instead of just whole cookies. I'm sure it will taste great at our picnic and I will update my review afterward. Thanks for the fun and easy recipe. I have to post my picture yet so that will be forthcoming. I'm starving.......\\n\\nWell, I'm back from my work outing and everyone loved it.  Even the bosses wife came up to me as I was leaving and said that she had to have the recipe.

Of course you can make your own too and that would be great if you do not mind one extra step, but then it might be easier just to make a baked chocolate cake, still this cake is so great its worth it  I would not recommend taking shortcuts, make the real filling it is well worth it and easy to make.

If you are having difficulty with this recipe, I'd suggest that the consistency is key, so measure carefully (like a baker.) Too much flour, a bit too much salt, not enough water or yeast, and you will end with a brick of glue. As with most baked goods, measure precisely and you will be amazed at the difference in the results. SIFT, SIFT, SIFT your flour. I don't sift flour for much because I generally don't bake, but with pancakes and pizza dough (the two flour-based recipes I use) I only get a consistent result when I measure consistently. Some comments below reference needing a bit more water, or having a dry crusty mess. Next time you try this recipe, measure 3.5 cups of (unsifted) flour and then sift it and measure again, you'll have 4+ cups of flour, which is not what you want in this! This is a great recipe for a good universal pizza dough. YMMV - I prefer to roll 4x 15&quot; diameter pizzas out of one batch. This is quite thin crust, but crispy like a cracker when cooked on a 550 degree pre-heated pizza stone.

Not only was this dish restaurant-quality, it was downright simple to make!!  A little time-consuming (especially since I did go all-out and do the shrimp stock), but virtually foolproof as long as you stir that roux religiously.  A couple of family members aren't wild about crayfish, so I omitted that and doubled up on the shrimp.  The only other changes I made were to cut the cayenne  from 1 tsp. to 1/2 tsp. and use 2 T. of Creole seasoning instead of 3.  We seriously love spicy foods, so I was just being a little cautious, fully expecting I'd need to go back later and add the rest.  Well, NOT!  The lesser amounts took it to the outer limits of my 'comfort zone' when it comes to heat, and I'm definitely not a wimp!  We love Tony Cachere's but find it way too salty when used in large amounts, so I mixed up Kittencal's cajun seasoning (recipe #186029).  Maybe Kitten's homemade version -- which was delicious, btw! -- packs a much bigger wallop than the commercial brands.  At any rate, I just wanted to warn you to add the seasonings gradually instead of all at once.  This stuff is too fabulous to risk messing up by getting heavy-\\nhanded with the 'heat'.

Even mixing it in a bowl, I wound up with bitter white chunks of unmixed flour scattered along the bottom of my pan. Be very careful to mix in all of the flour.

I halved the recipe and made it in a 9-inch round pan (I mixed in in a bowl because the pan was so shallow). When I was in college, they used to give us crazy cake quite often in the dorms.

The onions were simply fantastic and instead of topping them on the cooked rice-lentil mixture, I mixed them into the same after removing from heat. That way everyone got to have the amazing onions instead of my brother simply gobbling them all up;) LOL. As for the dried lentils, I used yellow lentils{yellow moong dal}. I think it would be nice for others who want to try this recipe, if the recipe poster could mention which lentils to use for this recipe{you know, there are red, yellow, black, green and brown lentils and one  might get confused, or maybe you could just mention that it is upto the person trying the recipe to use his/her choice of lentils!}. I did not have olive oil on hand, so I substituted it with Pure Wesson Canola oil. As for the cumin seeds, I used 2 tsps. which I felt was just about perfect. It would be nice if one could mention how much black pepper to use for this. I took a guess and used 20 whole black peppercorns{unfortunately, since I do not have a grinder, I could not turn these into powder and had to use them whole only}. But, I definitely felt that this dish would taste much better if it was more spicy. Next time, I will be using some red chilli powder as well. What was worth admiring was how beautiful this looked when I lifted the lid off after cooking it for 25 minutes on simmer. It was so eye-catching that I wanted to grab my camera and click a pic! I did soak the lentils for about 30 minutes and the rice as well for the same amount of time. I did boil the lentils in 2 changes of water and threw off the scum both the times. That way I knew for sure that the lentils are cooked before adding them to the pot in which I was cooking this dish. The MOST IMPORTANT thing that I want to share about this is that the dish was very starchy{because the rice was cooked in the 3 cups of water and the water was not drained}.     Hence, next time onwards, I will be making this in a slightly different manner. I will be cooking the rice separately in 3 cups of SALTED boiling water until all the water has been absorbed by the rice{this is the starch-filled rice}. Now, I would put this cooked rice in a rice strainer and put it under a cold water tap. I would stir it with a spoon and let the starch get washed away COMPLETELY. Then, I will put the rice on a large plate and cook it in the microwave for 5-10 minutes. Once this is done, I know my rice is ready. Also, I will cook the lentils the same way I did today - i.e., in 2 changes of boiling water and then drain the water and scum, once the lentils are thoroughly cooked. Then, I would add the cooked rice and lentils to the cumin seeds and black peppercorns that I'd have crackled in hot oil in a pot.            Next, I would garnish it with the crispy fried onions and serve! This way I will be eating it guilt-free and STARCH-FREE! I'm sure this way I could go on eating it forever:) Thanks for posting!"},{"name":"ginger garlic  beef stir fry","steps":"mix beef and eggs together in a bowl', 'dissolve 3 / 4 cup cornstarch in 1 / 2 cup cold water , the add to the beef / egg mixture', 'toss to combine with beef', 'in a small bowl whisk together soy sauce , cooking wine , vinegar , sesame oil and sugar', 'set aside', 'heat about 3-4 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok to hot but not smoking', 'add in the beef mixture to the hot oil adding in batches at a time', 'separate with a fork , cook stirring frequently until crispy , repeat with remaining beef', 'set aside and drain oil in the wok', 'add in about 1 tablespoon fresh oil to the wok , then add in dried chili flakes , carrots , green onion , fresh chopped ginger and garlic', 'saute until the carrots are crisp-tender', 'add in the soy sauce mixture', 'bring to a boil', 'add in the cooked beef strips', 'mix to combine until coated and heated through', 'serve over cooked hot rice'","description":"adjust the garlic, ginger and chili flakes to taste.","ingredients":"sirloin', 'eggs', 'cornstarch', 'water', 'vegetable oil', 'dried chili pepper flakes', 'carrot', 'green onions', 'fresh ginger', 'fresh garlic', 'soy sauce', 'cooking wine', 'white vinegar', 'sesame oil', 'sugar'","review":"Excellent!
