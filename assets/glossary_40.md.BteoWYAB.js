Creaming well, sifting the flour before measuring and using well beaten eggs had a lovely soft dough which made for  great tasting cookies looking like they had come from a high end bakery. Presifting the flour before measuring and well beaten eggs may be the answer.  Made mine larger which had me baking for 12 minutes.

But I did taste it with the raw middles, and the steaks were melt-in-your-mouth juicy and flavorful. I toasted sesame seeds, as someone else recommended and served with those as a garnish. The big problem for me was that even though I washed and dried the steaks first, with all the chunky bits cooked into the fish from the marinade, it was hard to tell what was marinade and which the clear, hard scales of the fish. I dont' know if this is a universal problem with the fish, or if it was just my particular fish or if I did something wrong.

I did make a few changes, as it was just DH and I for dinner.  I used a 5+ lb roaster chicken and didn&#039;t actually weight the cheesecloth, just cut it to cover the chicken and then again for the herbs.  Not sure if this was a typo, but thinking so, I feel 8 sticks of butter (2 lbs) is way too much, even though I just love butter, for a 15 lb turkey.  I used less then 1 stick, about 6-7 tablespoons, some to rub over the skin and the rest in with the herbs and wine used for basting, which was perfect for my smaller chicken, but would probably cut back a little on that amount next time.  I used fresh thyme and sage for my herbs, chardonnay wine (one mini bottle from a 4 pack) and put a couple of chunks of onion and fresh lemon in the cavity.  End result was just fantastic!!!  Definitely will be doing this for our next roasted chicken or turkey!!!  I posted 3 photos, just of the pre and post cooking of the bird, as Corilayn has an awesome photo of the finished turkey!!

The date mixture was thick pretty much immediately, so how thick is thickened? What heat setting should the mixture be cooked at? Since you are basically making candy or caramel, to what temperature should the mix be cooked? I believe that mine was way overcooked and I didn't even make it to 10 minutes cook time. Once it started to cool, it hardened up and it became very difficult to stir anything in. I ended up with about 30 barely holding together (very hard) balls, and about 1 1/4 cup of date/pecan streusel, which I'm sure will be excellent on ice cream so won't go to waste, but it wasn't really what I was aiming for by making this recipe. I did use butter instead of margarine (which I believe would not have contributed to my issues) and roasted, salted pecans. The taste of the mixture is good, so I hope with some clearer instructions, this could be a successful recipe."},{"name":"cheese olive raisin sandwiches","steps":"mix cheese and dressing until smooth', 'add olives and raisins', 'spread on 8 slice', 'top with remaining slices', 'makes 8 sandwiches'","description":"now this may sound a tad strange, but hey, try it! this is great on any bread, but i like pumpernickel, whole wheat, and rye! this came out of woman's day encyclopedia of cookery. using cream cheese, this is an english recipe.","ingredients":"cream cheese', 'french dressing', 'pimento stuffed olive', 'seedless raisin', 'bread'","review":"Double yummy!

Instead of water I used 3 cups chicken broth to 1 1/2 c Basmati rice. I poured it all into my rice cooker. Turned it on and voila! When I fluffing the rice before serving I added 1/2 pine nuts and skipped the fruit because my guys do not like fruit in their rice. It was very good and even my picky 6 yr old had seconds.

I didn't have any tortillas on hand and we were in a hurry so I think I served it as a one pot meal.<br/>I did have to make some substitutions due to what I had on hand. No green chiles and just a small amount of sweet pepper so I also added some carrots in step 1. I added some jalepeno tabasco sauce but never did quite make it to spicy. That was for the best though since my family has a low spice tolerance! My apples were on the small side so I added 2 and didn't regret it. I used chicken stock and brown rice. The black olives and raisins were omitted. Hubby said he would like the olives and I was thinking of only adding the raisins next time.

And just so great knowing that they were so low in fat and in calories!  One could actually feel virtuous eating them!  The only changes I made were basically to suit taste preferences.  I used fresh mushrooms and no dried mushrooms, and minced 6 cloves of garlic and sauted them with the onions and mushrooms rather than using garlic granules which Ive never used.  I omitted the Worcestershire sauce and added probably a tablespoon more soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons rather than I teaspoon of liquid smoke.  To increase the blend of onion flavours, I also used one leek C white part only, finely chopped then minced.  I was a bit nervous about what the consistency would be like, whether the burgers would hold together.  Ilightly greased an oven tray, then I used those metal rings (also lightly greased) that are used for poaching eggs and spooned the mixture into these with a spoon, so there was no messy handling with fingers.  This made that stage very easy!  The burgers were easy to turn over part way through the cooking.  I served them with salad greens and crusty rolls.  And I know Ill be making these again.

Then I added in the carrots, green onions,  and some very thin sliced red pepper strips. I think I might even add in some snow pea pods in the future. The end result is so gorgeous.
