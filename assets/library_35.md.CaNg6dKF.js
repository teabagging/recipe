I don't know if that was right or not, but the pie did stand together, so it apparently worked. I had a hard time incorporating the egg whites into the filling-I had to stir and stir. My guess is that this must be normal since the recipe says to incorporate them gradually. I didn't know how long to chill the filling before I mixed in the Cool Whip, so I let it chill about 1 1/2 hours, until I was ready to plate up my dinner. Then I added in the Cool Whip and put it in the pie crust-this worked out great, because the pie crust didn't get soggy. I topped it with Cool Whip.

I think what's missing here is some sliced FRESH ginger, and lots of it ;) I live in Hawaii and most people here make shoyu chicken with fresh ginger. It really changes the flavor. See if your grocery store carries 'hand's of fresh ginger in the produce section. It is a brown root with 'finger' sized branches. I just peel a 4 inch hunk, and slice into 1/4 inch or so pieces until you have about a 1/3 cup pieces (rough chop). This makes it easy to separate hunks out before eating, as you don't actually eat the cooked ginger. If you cook this with real ginger, and equal parts of liquid ingredients, I think you will see a big difference in the flavor.

Also, I thought the wild mushrooms were supposed to be fresh, so I used portabella.  As I was making the chowder I saw your description said dried wild mushrooms, so I threw in a few dried porcini's.  Next time I make this (and there will definitely be a next time), I will use less water like another reviewer mentioned, as my chowder was a little thin using 4 cups.  Maybe this would also be helped by using dried instead of fresh mushrooms, which would soak up some of the liquid.  Thanks for an excellent lunch.

My screen shows 4 (14.5 ounces), which comes to 7.25 cups, assuming a cup of 8 ounces! (maybe there was a typo that got corrected)\\n\\nAnyway, excellent recipe as it is. Three suggestions for amendment:\\n\\n1) Acidity/Sharpness - First time I made the dish it seemed lacking in acidity (for my tastes). I added a teaspoon of sour salt (citric acid), which worked fine. The second time I instead added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, which worked even better!\\n\\n2) Herbiness - I wanted to make the soup just a little more fancy for a dinner. I experimented by taking two small portions and adding a single herb to each to see which worked better. I tried dried basil in one and dried tarragon in the other. The basil tips the taste toward Italianesque, which is OK, but it was the tarragon that really worked. I would estimate a heaping teaspoon of dried tarragon, finely rubbed between the palms at the time it is added--make sure you serve it with sour cream as suggested! If you slightly warm and salt the sour cream before adding it you can stir it in decoratively, too!\\n\\n3) It's common practice to add some sort of starch product to soups like this to make them more suitable as a main course. After several experiments, I've settled onmy favorite addition: dried, stuffed tortellini. WHile I suppose any tortellini would work (fresh-packed, frozen, etc.), the ones that have worked best for me are the tiny (dime-sized) cheese-filled but full dried sort imported from Italy. I found them originally at a CostPlus, but my local supermarket started carrying a brand recently.\\n\\nThere's no need to pre-cook the tortellini separately from the soup. The trick I developed is to pre-soak the tortellini in hot water for a half-hour or so-- otherwise the thickness of the soup seems to set up some sort of osmotic-pressure deficiency that keeps the little buggers from ever fully rehydrating.\\n\\nNow if you like your pasta additions 'al dente', or even just somewhat firm, cooking them separately and adding them at serving time is probably the best. But *I* have a weakness for somewhat gooey pasta in my soup...nothing is more satisfying than chicken soup with parsnips and egg noodles that have soaked up much of the chicken fat, cooked so long the noodles have swollen to almost twice their normal size...\\n\\nAnyway, if the pre-soaked tortellini are simmered for an hour in the soup, they become absolutely delectable.\\n\\nOf course, in the end, it's up to you...here's to infinite variation!"},{"name":"ramen noodle with chicken","steps":"prepare noodles as directed or preference , adding hot sauce and chili powder', 'heat chicken', 'cut chicken into small pieces', 'add chicken to soup when soup is done'","description":"i got tired of just plain ramen noodles so i started adding stuff to make it more interesting.\\n\\ni get the tyson precooked boneless breast because you get around 12 for about $5.00. this makes the total around $9.00 with one meal about $.75.(very rough estimation). can yield up to about 12 servings from one bag of breasts and a pack of noodles per breast. you can also substitute left over meat of just about any kind.","ingredients":"ramen noodles', 'boneless chicken breast', 'hot sauce', 'chili powder'","review":"Wow, this is absolutely fabulous!

They wanted to bunch together. I shaped as directed, and you end up with a large, flat loaf. There were some areas where the red peppers congregated. I think it's a bread to eat up pretty fast, as the peppers stay moist. Also, the bread stuck to the sheet, even though it was well oiled.  A little hard to make sandwiches from it - I think I would use this next time as an accompaniment to soup or stew. Also, I am going to try sprinkling a little flour on the peppers, to see if that helps them incorporate a little more easily into the dough.

Thank you for sharing your family's recipe! <br/><br/>Some additional notes: I don't have a food processor but kept the butter cold and mixed it with AP flour in my Kitchen Aid mixer.  When it became crumbly, I kept it in the refrigerator until I needed it again (oops no pun intended:)  When I kneaded, I used my one hand and a wooden spoon; no problems but dough hook may even be easier!  <br/><br/>Roll out the dough at the very end!  It is very sticky indeed - which is a good thing because it makes for a moist cake - but keep it in the refrigerator until you've made the filling.  I rolled the dough over a well floured silpat baking mat because it makes for less mess than over my countertop and worked quickly with the filling and final rolling.  Working quickly with cold dough means there is last chance for disaster! <br/><br/>For those of you who aren't familiar with using yeast: I used 2% milk and wasted two cups of it and 2 packages of dry active yeast because I didn't know how to properly make yeast froth!

On one of my cookie sheets, I had trouble getting the cookies off, so for the next batch, I sprayed it lightly with PAM - no problem.  I wasn't sure how much to smoosh the cookie balls, so I'm not sure if my cookies are too thin, but I didn't have any problems getting them off the baking sheets (see above exception). They're wonderful with tea - thin and crispy.  I wish I'd thought to dip the glass in green and red colored sugar - that would be pretty for the holidays.

First, I warmed my water for the yeast to 110 degrees F (just a few seconds in the microwave and then stuck my kitchen thermometer to check the temp). Next, the recipe has baking soda in the ingredient list but does not say where to add it and so I left that out, it was really not needed. Also, it says to add salt in the directions but no salt is in the ingredient list so I found that this amount of flour in other recipes took 1 tsp salt so I added that much. I used King Arthur all-purpose flour, Red Star yeast, and double strength vanilla. For the cinnamon filling, I used the same amounts of cinnamon and butter here but I mixed 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar instead of all brown sugar.

I substituted raspberry juice for the port wine since I don't use wine in my cooking. I simmered the berries in 1/2 cup of the juice so they would plump while cooking. The bread took around 45 minutes to cook in the Bundt pan.

Wonderfully creamy and flavoursome, and so easy to make.  Love all the ingredients in this, and was pleased it called for boneless skinless chicken (I used chicken thighs) as this is what I prefer to use.  I anticipated this being a winner, and I was even more delighted with the finished dish than I'd anticipated, so I'll certainly be making this again.  The only slight change I made was to use three cloves of garlic (I usually up the garlic!).  No need for any other adjustments: after all, the recipe already included wine and mushrooms and leeks and thyme!  I confess to having been a tad nervous about leaving the cream out for so long, so I settled on leaving it out for about half of the cooking time.  Excellent idea, so that you are not adding a cold ingredient right at the end of the cooking time.  And to make room for the cream, as *Parsley* observed in an earlier review, DO heed instruction 7: removal of 1/4 cup of cooking juices!

I made it as a dessert for a latin-themed dinner which consisted of stuffed bell peppers and chips & homemade salsa. Since I was making it for two (and wanted some leftovers) I cut this recipe in half. For the cookies, I used Marias which can be found in the ethnic foods/Latin foods aisle. They were perfect for this dish. I didn't want to make them too soggy, so I only dipped them in the milk for a second. This is definitely a dessert that needs to be chilled in the fridge for an hour before it is really enjoyed!"},{"name":"raspberry lemonade marshmallows","steps":"lightly spray 11x15 baking sheet with non stick cooking spray', 'combine raspberry puree and the gelatin in a medium bowl and whisk until well blended and smooth', 'set aside', 'combine lemon juice , corn syrup , salt and sugar in a 6-quart sauce pan on medium heat', 'bring the mixture to a boil , be sure to brush the sides of the pan with a clean , moistened pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals from forming', 'using a candy thermometer , continue to boil the mixture until it reaches 240f do not stir', 'remove pan from heat and stir in the gelatin mixture', 'transfer mixture to a stand mixer with a whisk attachment', 'whip mixture for 12 minutes - starting on the lowest setting and gradually increasing to high', 'add lemon zest to mixture and whip for 30 more seconds', 'scrape mixture into sheet pan and let set at room temperature at least 4', 'after mixture has cooled and set , combine cornstarch and confectioners sugar and dust onto top', 'carefully coat a knife with more cornstarch mixture and cut into cubes , shaking each cube to remove excess powder'","description":"adapted from joy of kosher website","ingredients":"raspberry puree', 'gelatin powder', 'fresh lemon juice', 'corn syrup', 'salt', 'granulated sugar', 'fresh lemon zest', 'cornstarch', confectioners' sugar]","review":"Awesome dessert!
