I dusty the table heavily and just added flour as I went just to keep if from sticking to the table and to my hands as I worked and I didn&#039;t get the pretty ropes I usually get when I make my Pulla.    Still after it was baked the loaves were gorgeous and delicious.  I don&#039;t know much about making Challah to know if the dough should be that wet.  I didn&#039;t knead more flour in, instead as I stated before I added as I went from my heavily dusted table.    When I first started out baking I would use Corian counter tops to kneed and form loaves,  and I am glad I switched to a wooden surface because I know this would have been a mess sticking on the Corian.  I thought the flavor was rich and unique and I did love the bread. The crust was just amazing too.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I weighed my bread flour instead of measuring it- 544 grams of bread flour.  I also added some various dough enhancers - 1/2 tsp diastatic malt, 1/8 tsp ascorbic acid, 1 tsp lecithin and 3 tsp vital wheat gluten.  I made it for tonight&#039;s dinner and it was wonderful.

The first time I halved it and I must have done something wrong because while the flavour was great the rice didn't get cooked properly.  Last might I made it again using the full recipe and checked it after 1 hour.  The rice was still quit hard so I added another 1/2 of broth and nuked it for 5 minutes before putting it back in the over to get a bit of a crust.  Perfect!  <br/>I'm giving this a four for the great taste and ease of prep and cooking.  When I make it again I would add an addition cup of liquid from the start.  It may be a problem with the difference in altitude effecting the absorbtion of liquid - who knows?

Of course, I don't think that it was at all the fault of the recipe, I just think I might have used the wrong cut of meat. Other than using what my DH referred to as very old cow lol for this recipe, it was very good.

I&#039;ve made the recipe provided here for several years now, although with salt pork only recently (less of a bacon flavor, which is a good thing).  What surprised me about the beans on their home turf was that the flavor was distinctly mollasses-forward, with a hint of vinegar.  This recipe, as I&#039;ve made it, is intensely sweet, with the molasses having a more minor role.  I wanted to email the restaurant and ask for tips but the website only provides a phone number.  While I liked this recipe, I found the Durgin Park Restaurant version to be more appealing for its more molasses oriented flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as the baking soda and changing the soaking water goes, I paraphrase Dianne Kennedy, the great cook and author, on the subject: &quot;if the recipe tells you to throw out the soaking water, throw out the recipe&quot;.

We were out of pork fatback, and the local 7-11 didn&#039;t carry any, and since I do not have a car, that was as far as I looked for fatback.  I remembered that I had Bacon Bits in the pantry, so I used Bacon Bits instead of pork fatback (my first ex-wife had enough shoulder meat on her &quot;fatback&quot; that I should have found her and cut me a slice!)  Since I didn&#039;t have any baking soda, but we had plenty of pop, I used a can on pop which was only a little anyway.  We didn&#039;t have any onions, but I had freeze-dried onion flakes in my pantry, so I used that instead of an onion.  I was out of sugar so I used some Sweet &amp; Low packets that I had stolen from Denny&#039;s over the years.  No molasses in the house either, wouldn&#039;t you know; so I used Aunt Jemima&#039;s Original Pancake Syrup instead.  I cooked up for as long as the power stayed on on top of the stove (apparently my babies mama forgot to pay the utility bill, so about four hours into cooking, we lost power).  Not to worry, I finished it on the charcoal grill.\\nNo one really liked this revised version at all.  It had a lighter-fluid taste and the texture was just all wrong.

After some thought I think it should be 5 stars because I followed the recipe as a starting point and just changed a few things so I still think it deserves the 5 star review. <br/><br/>Some have said it's mushy but I don't think so.  It's fork tender is what it is. I have made meatballs in the oven many a times but the meatballs tend to be not so tender or moist when done in the oven so following this recipe by placing in the sauce for hours is a better way to go.  It leaves the meatballs nice and moist and tender, not dried out as in the oven.  Now what I might do next time is brown in some oil for a couple of minutes on each side then place in the sauce for a couple of hours.  I think if you brown all sides of the meatballs you'll seal off the meatballs from having the sauce flavor from penetrating them and will get less flavor so maybe just brown on one side and flip over and brown on another but not on all four sides.   Just enough to brown and put in sauce.  If you don't brown all sides then the unbrowned sides will have a chance to absorb the sauce flavor.  If you brown every inch you'll not be able to allow the meatballs to absorb the sauce flavor and also might not be as tender inside anyway. <br/><br/>What I did different is I used 50/50 ground beef and pork.  Used two cloves of garlic I crushed instead of powder.  I added 1/4 tsp of basil.  I did not have prepackaged bread crumbs but had some hard french loaf left so I put that in the food processor and ran the unit but they did not come out like crumbs you buy in the store but came out like a powder which works well.  Next time I make these I will use fresh basil and cut the Parmesan cheese to about 1/8 cup rather than 1/4 as it calls for and see what happens.  I also cooked in sauce for 2 hours not 3 hours.  <br/><br/>Overall it is a great recipe and with my mods to the recipe I think it was great.

First of all I would never put raw meat in my sauce or gravy, I fried mine first or you could broil them (or they will fall apart).  Secondly, I don't know many italians who cook oregano, oregano gets very very bitter when cooked too long(3 hours is toooo long).  I never heard of cooking any type of spaghetti sauce (gravy) 3 hours unless it was a Sicilian sauce and then they have to add sugar to account for the bitterness of such a long cook!  Italian tomato sauces were made to cook up fast, few ingredients, and definately no oregano while cooking, add it at the end if you must have it.  Basil and parsley taste so much better.  Also, use the grease from the fried or broiled meatballs in your sauce, excellent!  Ethnic italian is so much different from these types of recipes.  These should be labled american italian.

The absolute best result I have had to date was the result of using fresh bread crumbs instead of dried and pan frying before dropping in sauce to cook through.Also, I use a food scoop for uniform size, and food prep gloves rather than bare hands, which not only cuts down on mess, but produces a smoother surface on the meatballs, which makes them brown beautifully and have a better bite and mouth feel.

They came out perfect and added depth and flavor to the sauce (In Memory of Brats Authentic Tomato Sauce - it&#039;s also awesome!).  I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to assure consistency in the size of the meatballs.  I tripled the recipe and froze the extras raw so I could defrost them and add them to a new batch of sauce.

I simmered them in Barilla marinara, enough to just about cover the 15 or so meatballs in the pot, for about two hours.  Complete success!

Forty-eight meatballs fed 12 adults and 6 children with a few left over. Plan 2 to 3 golf-ball size meatballs per person. Not browning made the recipe much easier and allowed the seasonings from the sauce and meatballs to wed. The consistency was well-liked. I was afraid of 12 whole cloves (6 doubled), usually a piercing flavor not present in most sauces.The flavor diminished as the sauce finished cooking. It definitely adds a nice demention. I suggest, if you are still worried, that you use half the cloves called for and add ground, if you regret the change. I would like to take off a little of the tomato sharpness of the sauce. Adding soda is a horrible idea; you want to smooth out the flavor, not ruin it! I'm going add a couple pounds of pork neck bones which will make the sauce slightly richer, smoother and very slightly gelatinous. It will stick even better to the noodles.

I followed the recipe to a tee and served them with spaghetti. I don't know why some commenters are so worried about broiling or cooking the meatballs first. You don't need to, it's just a waste of valuable time. Mine stayed together just fine. The trick, I think is to make the meatballs first and let them sit for a bit while you start the sauce so the breadcrumbs can absorb the egg and juices which in my opinion helps bind them together. Also, just gently drop each ball into the sauce and don't stir for a while until they are cooked. The raw meatballs, as I read in another comment are also supposed to help flavour the sauce as they cook. I can certainly agree with that.

I was a chef in the New Orleans area for 10 years. I've always browned off the meatballs before putting them in the sauce, but dropping them straight in the sauce, to me, is so much better! So juicy and full of flavor. If one thinks about it, when meat cooks, it contracts and firms up, so precooking them may block some of the sauce from entering the meatballs. By dropping them in raw, the meat seems to pull in the sauce as they cook, absorbing the sauce. The flavor of the meatballs releases in the sauce. A marriage of flavors. The texture is superb, a great ratio of ingredients. It makes an unbelievable gravy! Like some others mentioned, drop them in the sauce and let them cook a little before you stir them so they don't fall apart.

I tweaked my mother's recipe and baked them rather than frying them. They came out good a few times but the last time, they were terrible. I decided to go on an internet search for a recipe that I could follow with precise measurements. I made these last Friday night. I was very careful to measure everything exactly -- I even weighed the meat on my digital scale. The only changes I made were: 1) I used one clove of fresh garlic, crushed, and 2) I used Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs. I simmered them in the sauce (my regular recipe) for the full 3 hours. They came out delicious! They were not at all mushy -- they were firm on the outside but juicy &amp; tender on the inside.
