However, the cream sauce saved the day after I scrapped off most of the pepper before serving the chicken.  The next time I make this dish (and I will make it again) I will only use 3 T of the pepper.

It is one of our favorite low calorie meals but it still tastes wonderful with the mixed pork and ground turkey. It tasted so much better than meatloaf in the oven. The only thing I did differently was I added about 1/2 cup of chopped onion to the meatloaf. For the sauce, I combined ketchup, worcestershire sauce and a little brown sugar. I added the sauce to the meatloaf about 15 minutes before the meatloaf was done cooking.
