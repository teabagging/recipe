I doubled the recipe and cooked a few on medium and a few on medium-high and I think we prefer them darker/crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, so I think the best way to do this is to cook them in the butter for approximately two minutes on medium-high until each side is crispy and blackened and then pour in the marinade, turn the heat to medium, cover, and cook for about 5-7 minutes until the marinade and chicken reach 165 degrees.  I used the \\"Taco Sauce\\" recipe from this site as the first ingredient which lent a nice flavor to the dish and served this with a side of mashed potatoes (because my husband eats them with every meal) topped with \\"Easy Black Beans and Tomatoes\\" from this site.  I also made a spinach salad as an additional side.  Overall, it was a nice weekday dinner (quick and easy), and my husband said the flavor of this chicken is one of his favorites.

In my area we use corn tortillas instead of flour and instead of topping with lettuce, guac, and pico we use cilantro, raw chopped onion, and green or red sauce. We also use the mini tortillas so we cut the beef into tiny cubes once it has rested. With that being said, my review is based on the actual recipe and not the suggested toppings. This works great and gets the meat nice and tender however I feel it needs more actual season. For the 2nd batch I left out the salt and added a couple packets of Sazon seasoning and they were delicious. Overall good recipe and one I would make again. Remember to not let your meat marinate too long.
