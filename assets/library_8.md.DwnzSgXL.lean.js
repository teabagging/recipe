My grandmother Vivian Rollins worked for the very first see&#039;s candy store on Western Ave. in Los Angeles starting in 1921.  She was hired because of her extensive experience with recipes and candy creations as her parents (my great grandparents) owned a Candy Store in Camarillo and then moved to Los Angeles to go into business with my Great Great Grandfather who owned a plumbing company on Western Ave.  The recipe actually did include Marshmellow creme (Marshmellow fluff) is what it was called back then.  It was very popular starting in 1917 and therefore was very expensive to put into a recipe as it was made from the sap of the Marsh Mallow plant and it was difficult to process or you had to purchase it from Egypt which was even more expensive, they originally used the marshmallow creme but then switched to Marshmallows in late 1948 because of the cost and availability factors. MarshMallows had been developed and had now turned into a sugar and gelatin substance and did not use the Marsh Mallow sap which made it much cheaper.  Mary and my Grandmother decided to us Marshmallows instead of the fluff.  My grandmother worked there for many many years and was instrumental in the development of many of the recipes.  I have the original recipe directly from my grandmother and it has been passed down to the girls in the family for 92 years now. I also have the 2nd recipe with the Marshmallows and all my grandmothers personal notes, comments, etc on the paper.  She loved working there and talked about it every chance she got.  It was the only thing she talked about constantly!  Childhood stories for me!  They also originally used sweetened condensed milk as evaporated milk was brand new on the market in the 1920&#039;s and hard to get.  Where are the Sweetened condensed milk had been around since the 1800&#039;s and had a longer shelf life and did not need refridgeration. So it seems that the recipe above is a mixed up version of both the recipes that were used.  The first recipe developed used Marshmallow creme and Sweetened condensed milk, the second recipe developed used Marshmallows and Evaporated milk.  My suggestion, play with it, see which one you like best!  They are both amazingly good recipes and everytime I make them, it brings back so many memories of my grandmother.  Isn&#039;t that the point of a good recipe? To enjoy it and share it with others? Not argue over who is right or wrong!

My grandmother worked at See's in the the thirties. Her &quot;original&quot; recipe handed down is almost the same here, except it had 18 ounces of chocolate (3, 6 ounce bags) of chocolate chips and 2 tsp of vanilla. My grandmother always used margarine and marshmallows and my mother always used butter and marshmallow creme. My grandmother said margarine was used in the 30s to keep the cost down during the depression, and I think the marshmallows had something to do with sugar rationing during WWII. I believe Guittard Chocolate Company, started in San Francisco in the late 1890s, makes a special brand of chocolate for See's. I've always used Nestle semi-sweet, but I'm going to try Guittard brand next time. See's fudge was the only recipe they published in the newspaper. My mother cut it out and I remember reading it, but that was in the 60s, I was 7 or 8. The LA times published the &quot;original&quot; recipe not long ago, here is the link if anyone is interested. http://recipes.latimes.com/recipe-sees-fudge/ I use Marshmallow creme, butter, and double the recipe of the LA Times version, except my chocolate amount is 18 oz instead of 12 (if you doubled the LA times recipe) this recipe has 24 oz. I've tried both and prefer 18 oz. I by huge bags of chocolate chips during the holidays, and just weigh out 18 oz. on my food scale. I have make this fudge several times for others throughout the year, because everyone loves it, and I nail it every time. It's so velvety smooth and so delicious. A few tips: I do, I butter down the sides of the pan before I cook the sugar and evap. milk, so sugar won't crystallize on the sides. I also pour the hot mixture over the marshmallow cream, butter and vanilla, after it is mixed and smooth, then I add the chocolate and melt it in. The mixture is still very hot, so the chips will melt. I use a hand mixer to help cool the fudge down for 5-10 min on med. speed, then fold in nuts. You end up with the most delicious smooth fudge. (I toast nuts for everything I make and did ONE time for this recipe... the relatives voted DOWN toasted nuts for this fudge...oh well, less thing to do. I use a 15-inch x 10-inch x 2-inch rectangular baking dish, and instead of buttering the dish, I line it with seran wrap and leave a few inches overhang on the handle sides. After chilling it firm, I can lift the whole 5lb slab of fudge out, take off the seran wrap, and place on a cutting board to easily cut into squares, to place on decorative plates, or gift boxes. Even if everyone's &quot;original&quot; recipes vary somewhat, the fudge is fantastic, and it's fun to experiment. You may come up with something even better. Lastly, I never actually had fudge from the See's store until bout 8 years ago. I bought a few pieces, and the homemade fudge tasted so much better. I love See's candy and whatever &quot;original&quot; recipe you use, it will be the best fudge ever."},{"name":"neiman marcus  250 chocolate chip cookies recipe","steps":"measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder', 'cream the butter and both sugars', 'add eggs and vanilla', 'mix together with flour , oatmeal , salt , baking powder and soda', 'add chocolate chips , grated hershey bar and nuts', 'roll into 1 inch balls and place 2-inches apart on a cookie sheet', 'bake for 10 minutes at 375 or until golden'","description":"i received this recipe from a friend","ingredients":"butter', 'flour', 'baking soda', 'sugar', 'blended oatmeal', 'chocolate chips', 'brown sugar', 'salt', 'hershey bars', 'eggs', 'baking powder', 'vanilla', 'nuts'","review":"I would be interested in the original recipe Jennifer K. speaks about.

I just wanted to note though, that the recipe calls for dried red kidney beans and some have mentioned using slow cookers. Using slow cookers with raw or dried red kidney beens is very dangerous. Red kidney beans need to reach full boil for a certain period of time (10 minutes has been suggested), i.e. a certain temperature, to break down the Phytohaemagglutnin (Kidney Bean Lectin) which is toxic. <br/>See http://www.foodreference.com/html/artredkidneybeanpoisoning.html. There may be some slow cookers that can safely do this, but not having one, or otherwise looking at them I do not know. All I know is that the article said that heating can actually worsen the toxicity if insufficient, So if you are not cooking the recipe as described, be careful.

I did brine my chops (I almost always do - 3 T salt in 1 1/2 qt. water for almost an hour), but I am not sure how effective it was this time... my son did it for me and I discovered that the salt didn't all dissolve. I followed the recipe exactly to the point of putting it in the oven. I cooked the dish for 30 min. At that point, the meat temp was 184F, or overcooked. Usually you would cook pork to 145F and let rest to about 155F. They were not dry and tasted good. That said, there was plenty of liquid and moisture in the covered pan for a proper oven braise, and 1 1/2 hours would have been perfect for that. The texture would be completely different, but tasty. I would like to try that if I made this again (but will likely not given that half my family didn't like it). I used Empire apples, which had a good flavor and moisture content.

I believe the article was called My Father's Shortbread and was a wonderful article. A couple of years ago, a finally broke down and started using a mixer instead of doing every step by hand! While the recipe is AWESOME, it is not particularly easy (the only thing keeping it from getting 4 stars). It is, however, the best thing you'll ever eat! I used to re-reasd the article every year as a ritual, but the magazine finally fell apart after our last move...and I think it was misplaced. As I recall, the original recipe calls for 4 cups of unbleached, all purpose flour, 1 lb. unsalted butter, 1 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt. I like the AP flour instead of the cake flour for the extra crunch. And I use the full teaspoon of salt plus salted butter...it adds a nice flavor and it is the only preservative in the recipe. Plan on spending an afternoon for all the chilling and slow cook times...rolling out the dough, getting the thickness right, measuring the 1 x2 pieces and pricking them is the real labor in this recipe (now that I use a mixer). The end result is worth it, though...make a couple of batches while you have the time set aside...you will start getting nudges from friends and relatives every year as Thanksgiving approaches.

I scored the dough by eye-balling the desired size &amp; chilled it overnight. Cutting the well-chilled dough &amp; pricking the cookies w/a fork the next day took only minutes.

Only other alteration I made was I doubled the relishes and instead of leaving th olives whole I chopped them in the food processor and I ran short  of lemon juice and did equal parts of lemon and lime juice and which worked well.

In fact, my husband had his done in no time flat & was licking his plate, which he never does! For the filling I combined 2 cups of mixed berries (blueberries, blackberries, & raspberries) plus 1 cup sliced strawberries & 1 cup sliced peaches. I also did 1/2 Splenda & 1/2 sugar, but I split the Splenda between the topping & the fruit to give the berries a little added sweetness. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream mixture and used fat free sour cream. It was absolutely wonderful. I made my own crust & baked the pie the night before to make sure that it was fully set & to let the flavors migle. It came out beautifully! Thank you so much for this excellent pie.

If you over cook it in the beginning it's going to be tough.  When I was finished cooking it (25mins) the meat was very juicy and soft.

I love fish, and had the opportunity to use a beautiful sea bass for this recipe.  This is one type of cooking where you really want to check for doneness with a thermometer- my fish looked raw, but temped perfectly, and when I flaked with a fork, came apart in lovely layers.  The sauce was perfectly balanced between savory and sweet; and although I felt I wanted more with each bite, I think more would just have been a bit too cloying and sweet.  This amount just left you wanting to cook the dish again- tomorrow!  Two of these vegetables-peppers and bok choy, are among my favorites.  Usually, when a dish calls for cooking carrots I leave them out- but this time I chose to leave them in for the color; and ended up liking them! Wow!  All of the veggies retained some of their crispness, and all of their flavor.  All of them benefited from the lovely sauce. Finally, we have the rice.  I have a rice cooker, so I didn't follow the directions given, but I used the ingredients as listed; and even tough I rarely eat white rice, I scarfed down every last grain on my plate.  It was a perfect match for the delicate fish and vegetables, yest the coconut milk added a richness that kept the dish from feeling too light.  Overall, I loved it, and can't wait to make it again!

My bok choy was still a little tough.  The carrots and bell pepper were perfect. My fish was perfectly tender and moist.  I used triggerfish, and it is always excellent!
