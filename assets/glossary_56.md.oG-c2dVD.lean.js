At first glance, 3 tablespoons of salt seemed excessive, but I assumed the salt was mostly to draw out liquid, like brining, which I've done and liked, and most would be removed after rinsing.  Still, I used only 2 tablespoons instead of the 3 listed, squeezed out as much of the brine as I could both before and after rinsing, which I did twice before adding the marinade.  I let the mixtue sit about an hour before I tasted it, and the cucumbers were still so salty they were inedible.  To try and save it I rinsed out the marinade, poured fresh water over, let it stand about 1/2 hour, and then tasted it again.  I had to do this 3 times before it was at a point I could add the marinade mixture again, let it sit and use it.  It was still salty, but at least edible.

I mixed one cup of mild salsa with one cup of medium salsa to get the desired spiciness.

I used baby carrots, which I chopped in a mini processor.  And because I  had rather more than 5 cups of potatoes, I added a couple of tablespoons of Greek yoghurt to the sour cream.  I used a low-fat sour cream.  After combining all the ingredients in step one, I transferred the potato mixture into four small casserole dishes with snug lids that can be added after cooking and cooling: one now consumed; the other three in the freezer.

I am so exicited I finally got this to work!  I have made butter before by skimming my own cream off of milk, but have never been able to get this to work. So, when I saw this recipe on this site, I thought I'd give it another shot.  I too used my kitchen aid mixer, which if you have one, I would reccommend. Simply because when it turn into butter, it all collects into the wisk an you can lift the top up and let it drip dry for a couple minutes!  The only thing I wasn't sure of was speed. What I learned was to use hi speed, but back it down a gear if it's splashing. When you start out it's a liquid. Start on speed 8 or it will spash. Once it takes on the whipping cream form, turn it on max. But stand by, because if your not there when the butter seperates from the liquid, it will go everywhere! So I slowly started backing it down!  After I put it in the bowl, I use the back of a spoon and squeeze out any excess milk I can and then I quicKly run cold water over it to wash it clean. just some tips I picked up from a butter making sight!  It's perfect and I am so happy to finally have this!!

I couldn&#039;t find my tired and true sour cream coconut cake recipe, so I searched the Internet. This one came up with 5 stars, so I thought I&#039;d try it. After being very disappointed, I searched and search and finally found my recipe. I started comparing the two. First, 16 oz of sour cream is way too much, and the fact that you don&#039;t mix anything with it makes it just plain Cool Whip-tasting - yuck. Mine calls for mixing some of the coconut mixture with the Cool Whip - gives it a great taste. I personally don&#039;t like eating straight Cool Whip. Then, only 1 cup of sugar for the coconut mixture just isn&#039;t enough (and I don&#039;t like things too sweet). Lastly, frozen coconut - I know, I know, everyone says to only use frozen coconut because it&#039;s very moist. I couldn&#039;t tell that it was more most than non-frozen coconut. But, the biggest letdown was the size of the frozen coconut. It&#039;s so thinly shredded that it just didn&#039;t taste like coconut. The texture is just weird. I will never use frozen coconut again. One other thing, there was so much sour cream and all that plain Cool Whip that the cake was just a liquid-like amateur cake. I&#039;ve been baking for years, but this cake looked like my kids assembled it. I did appreciate the callout to purchase Duncan Hines and the tips on preparing the cake in advance."},{"name":"coconut mousse","steps":"in a bowl mix condensed milk with coconut milk', 'dissolve the gelatin with 2 tablespoons water in microwave for 15 seconds , allow to cool', 'meanwhile , beat the egg whites until soft peaks form', 'stir the milk mixture into the gelatin , and gently beat into the whipped the egg whites', 'place in bowls and refrigerate for 2 hours', 'at serving time garnish with chocolate shavings and cherries'","description":"light coconut mousse, from marta benica","ingredients":"sweetened condensed milk', 'coconut milk', 'gelatin', 'water', 'egg whites', 'chocolate bar', 'cherries'","review":"I had gotten this cake recipe some time ago and just made it.

This reminds me of dishes I've had at Indian restaurants...and the cumin and fennel seeds really make this extra special. That said, I initially thought it was a bit too soupy and possibly that I overcooked the potatoes by about an hour. But after reheating some leftovers I changed my mind. I think that if I served this over basmati rice the way it would be eaten at an Indian restaurant rather than just on my plate, it wouldn't have been too soupy. If you don't want to serve it over rice, then maybe add a tbsp of flour or cornstarch to the coconut milk at the end so it thickens up a bit. And I decided the potatoes weren't overcooked at 4 hours in the crockpot before adding the milk...they were just softer than the way I usually make them, but still very good.

My eggplant weighed 1 pound and with 1/4 inch slices this made two layers in my casserole.  It fit perfectly.  Like another reviewer I had trouble using the gallon bag to bread my fritters (it worked fine for dusting them with flour, but was too messy with the egg wash), so I put the breadcrumbs in a shallow pie plate to dredge them.  I seasoned the breadcrumbs with 1.5 tablespoons of italian seasoning.  I put the breaded slices on a baking rack over a sheet pan and sprayed liberally with PAM olive oil spray.  Mine took about 20 minutes in a 450F oven and then 5 minutes of broiling.  I had a couple fritters leftover that my partner and I both snacked on.  Yummy!
